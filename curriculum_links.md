# KS2 Curriculum Links — Spring 2026 Tinkercad Term

## KS2 Computing
- **Creating Media (Digital Content):** Pupils use Tinkercad to create, edit and present 3D models for simple briefs (e.g. tags, stands, toys).  
- **Programming (Extension, Week 8):** Codeblocks introduces loops, parameters and transforms to generate repeated geometry.  
- **Logical Reasoning and Evaluation:** Pupils explain why designs work or fail (e.g. walls too thin, poor orientation, no clearance).  

## KS2 Design & Technology
- **Design:** Pupils develop ideas for products with specific users and purposes (name tags, stands, spinners, badges). They communicate designs through digital models and simple annotations.  
- **Make:** Pupils select virtual tools (align, group, mirror, hole, generator) and use measurement and positioning accurately in a CAD environment.  
- **Evaluate:** Pupils compare early and improved versions of their designs, reflect on usability and aesthetics, and respond to peer feedback.  
- **Technical Knowledge:** Pupils gain basic understanding of structures, stability, simple mechanisms (axles and wheels), and constraints for 3D printing (wall thickness, supports, orientation, tolerances).  

## KS2 Maths
- **Number & Measurement:** Use millimetres as standard units; reason about approximate sizes for real-world objects (e.g. keyring, badge, stand).  
- **Geometry:** Explore 3D shapes, symmetry, rotation and simple scaling.  
- **Data & Reasoning:** Informal use of comparisons (stronger/weaker, thicker/thinner) and basic estimation.

## Science & Engineering Links
- **Materials & Forces:** Discuss strength, brittleness, overhangs and how load paths affect designs.  
- **Mechanisms:** Explore how axles, hubs and wheels create motion, and how friction can help or hinder movement.  
- **Circuits (Week 9):** Use virtual breadboards to reinforce simple electrical concepts (LEDs, resistors, polarity).  

## Art & Design
- **Visual Communication:** Use shape, colour, pattern and symmetry to create appealing designs.  
- **Identity & Personalisation:** Create badges, tags and models that express personal interests or roles in the school community.
