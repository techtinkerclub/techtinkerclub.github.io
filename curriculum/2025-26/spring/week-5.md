## Week 5 — Sketch & Revolve

**Focus Concept:** Using Sketch tool + Revolve for curved 3D forms  
**Mini-Project:** *Rocket Bottle / Vase / Simple Cup*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Parametric 3D generation via revolve.</li>
    <li><strong>Design & Technology:</strong> Sketching profiles for products.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Rotational symmetry & profiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Art & Design:</strong> Smooth curved forms & aesthetics.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wall thickness & stability.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Learners use the new **Sketch** tool to draw a 2D profile, then generate a 3D shape by revolving it.

## Objectives
- Draw a clean profile using Sketch.  
- Use Revolve to create a solid.  
- Adjust thickness & proportions.

## Success Criteria
- I can draw a simple profile sketch.  
- I can revolve it into a 3D form.  
- I can refine proportions cleanly.

## Key Vocabulary
- **Sketch** — a 2D drawing used to create 3D objects.  
- **Profile** — the outline used for revolve.  
- **Revolve** — spin a profile around an axis.  
- **Axis** — the line the shape rotates around.

---

## Part A — Explore Sketch
Create straight/curved profiles.

## Part B — Revolve
Generate a bottle/cup/rocket.

## Part C — Extend
Add decorations using normal tools.
