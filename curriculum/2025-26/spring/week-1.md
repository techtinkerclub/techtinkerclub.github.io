This week introduces Tinkercad navigation, placing shapes, resizing, rotating and grouping through a simple, confidence‑building project.

---

## Objectives
- Navigate Tinkercad confidently (orbit, pan, zoom).  
- Place and resize basic shapes accurately.  
- Group simple shapes to create a product.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can move around the 3D workspace.  
- I can resize and rotate shapes.  
- I can make a simple name tag or keyring.

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Orbit** — rotating the view around your model.  
- **Pan** — sliding the view left, right, up or down.  
- **Zoom** — moving the camera closer or farther away.  
- **Group** — joining shapes into one object.  

---

## Part A — Explore Tools
- Try orbit, pan, zoom.  
- Drop simple shapes onto workplane.

## Part B — Build the Tag
- Add a base rectangle or round plate.  
- Add initials or name letters.

## Part C — Extend
- Add a loop for keyring.  
- Try simple decoration.
