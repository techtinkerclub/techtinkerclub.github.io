      <h1>How to Use the Tech Tinker Club Quiz</h1>

      <p>
        This quiz helps children review and strengthen ideas learned in Tech Tinker Club sessions.
        Each week covers a different topic from our Micro:bit projects — such as inputs and outputs,
        loops, conditions, variables, and sensors — with a mix of multiple-choice and drag-and-drop questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is not to memorise facts, but to practise logical thinking. The questions encourage children to
        read <em>pseudocode</em> (a simplified way of writing code) and to predict what the Micro:bit would do step by step.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Take the Quiz</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose a week:</strong> Each week matches a club topic. Start with one you’ve already covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Read carefully:</strong> Go line-by-line through any pseudocode before answering.</li>
        <li><strong>Answer:</strong> Click the best choice or drag terms into boxes for match-type questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Hints:</strong> Some questions include a hint — using it won’t affect your score.</li>
        <li><strong>Submit and review:</strong> Check your answer, read the feedback, and continue.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat freely:</strong> The quiz doesn’t save data; it’s for open practice and exploration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Pseudocode</h2>
      <p>
        Pseudocode is a simple, human-readable way of writing a program. It describes what the program does without
        worrying about exact punctuation or syntax. It sits halfway between everyday language and real code.
      </p>

      <p>In MakeCode, you build programs from coloured blocks. The same logic in pseudocode might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>repeat 3 times
  show icon "heart"
  pause 200
  clear screen
  pause 200
end
</code></pre>

      <p>
        This means exactly the same as the blocks: show a heart, pause briefly, and repeat three times.
        Pseudocode is great for tracing logic on paper and for discussing ideas before building them.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Solving Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use paper:</strong> Track values like <code>x</code>, <code>score</code>, or <code>level</code> as they change.</li>
        <li><strong>Do small maths:</strong> Convert seconds to milliseconds (e.g., 3 s = 3000 ms) before dividing by a pause time.</li>
        <li><strong>Circle conditions:</strong> Pay attention to <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&ge;</code>, and <code>=</code>; they mean different things.</li>
        <li><strong>Read sensors correctly:</strong> Accelerometer X is positive when tilted right, negative when tilted left.
          Only “big” tilts count if a threshold is given (e.g., |X| &gt; 200).</li>
        <li><strong>Debug slowly:</strong> If something seems odd, go line by line and say it out loud.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Blocks vs Pseudocode</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blocks</strong>: colourful puzzle pieces in MakeCode.</li>
        <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>: tidy text steps that mean the same thing.</li>
        <li>Both follow the same logic — inputs → decisions/loops → outputs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>For Families</h2>
      <p>
        Mistakes are part of learning. Encourage children to read feedback carefully, try again, and explain their
        thinking. Short, regular practice works better than long sessions.
