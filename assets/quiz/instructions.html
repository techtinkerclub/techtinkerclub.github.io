      <h1 id="tqi-title">How to Use the Tech Tinker Club Quiz</h1>

      <p class="tqi-muted">
        This quiz is designed to help children review and strengthen the ideas they’ve learned in Tech Tinker Club sessions.
        Each week covers a different topic from our Micro:bit projects — such as inputs and outputs, loops, conditions,
        variables, and sensors — with a mix of multiple-choice and drag-and-drop questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim is not to test memory, but to practise logical thinking and reasoning. The questions encourage children to read
        short snippets of <strong>pseudocode</strong> (a simplified way of writing code) and to think about what the Micro:bit
        would do step by step. This is an important skill in programming — understanding how instructions flow and predicting
        what will happen before testing it.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Take the Quiz</h2>

      <p><strong>Choose a week</strong><br/>
      Each week corresponds to a theme from club sessions. Start with the one you’ve already covered in class.</p>

      <p><strong>Read each question carefully</strong><br/>
      Questions may include a short piece of pseudocode. Read it line by line, as if it were real code blocks in MakeCode.</p>

      <p><strong>Select or drag your answer</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>For multiple-choice questions, click the option you believe is correct.</li>
        <li>For drag-and-drop questions, match terms to their correct definitions by dragging them into the boxes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Use hints if needed</strong><br/>
      Some questions offer a hint to help guide your thinking. Using a hint won’t affect your score.</p>

      <p><strong>Submit and review</strong><br/>
      After submitting, you’ll see whether your answer was correct and a short explanation of why. Read the reasoning carefully —
      it often contains key ideas that will help in the next question.</p>

      <p><strong>Move to the next question</strong><br/>
      Once you finish all questions in a week, you’ll see your score and can return to try another week at any time.</p>

      <p class="tqi-muted">
        You don’t need to finish everything in one go. The quiz saves nothing permanently, so it’s meant for open practice — you can revisit questions freely.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding Pseudocode</h2>

      <p><strong>What is pseudocode?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Pseudocode is a simplified, human-readable way of writing a program. It describes what the program does without
        worrying about exact syntax or punctuation. It sits halfway between natural language and real code.
      </p>

      <p>
        In MakeCode, we build programs using colourful puzzle-like blocks. Pseudocode expresses those same ideas using words and
        indentation, for example:
      </p>

      <pre class="tqi-code">repeat 3 times
  show icon "heart"
  pause 200
end</pre>

      <p>This means exactly the same as using the blocks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A repeat loop that runs three times.</li>
        <li>Inside, the heart icon appears.</li>
        <li>The program pauses for 200 milliseconds.</li>
        <li>Then the loop repeats until it has run three times.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why use pseudocode?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>It helps children read logic.</em> By removing the colour and shape of blocks, pseudocode focuses attention on meaning — sequence, conditions, and loops.</li>
        <li><em>It builds transferable skills.</em> The same logic applies later in Python or JavaScript; tracing pseudocode is the first step.</li>
        <li><em>It improves debugging skills.</em> Plain text encourages slower, more deliberate thinking and helps spot mistakes before running a program.</li>
        <li><em>It prepares for secondary computing.</em> Pseudocode appears throughout KS3–KS4/GCSE Computer Science, easing the move from blocks to text.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Helpful Tips for Working Through the Quiz</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Take your time.</strong> These questions are about understanding logic, not speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Use paper and pencil.</strong> Jot down variable changes or loop counts. If <code>x = 2</code> and the code says <em>repeat 3 times change x by 1</em>, write 3, 4, 5.</li>
        <li><strong>Read conditions carefully.</strong> Small symbols matter:
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;</code> means less than</li>
            <li><code>&gt;</code> means greater than</li>
            <li><code>=</code> means exactly equal to</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Check how loops work.</strong> <em>repeat N times</em> runs a set number; <em>forever</em> never stops; <em>while (condition)</em> runs only while something is true.</li>
        <li><strong>Think about timing.</strong> Pauses are in milliseconds (ms). <code>1000 ms = 1 s</code>. For “3 seconds at 50 ms per update” → <code>3000 ÷ 50 = 60</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Relate pseudocode to MakeCode blocks.</strong> Map lines to blocks: <em>if … then</em> → If block; <em>repeat N times</em> → Repeat loop; <em>on button A pressed</em> → Event.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay curious.</strong> If something’s unclear, rebuild it in MakeCode later and see what the Micro:bit does.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Practising Logic Matters</h2>

      <p>
        This quiz isn’t about memorising commands — it’s about learning how computers think. By reasoning through loops,
        conditions, and variables, children develop computational thinking: breaking problems down, predicting outcomes,
        and debugging mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those skills go far beyond programming. They build confidence in problem-solving, mathematics, and clear step-by-step
        reasoning — all essential parts of STEM learning.
