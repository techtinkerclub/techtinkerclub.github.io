# Teacher Notes — Week 1  
**Theme:** Welcome & Micro:bit Basics  
**Focus Concept:** Events & Sequencing  
**Mini-Project:** Digital Name Badge  

---

## Learning Objectives
- Pupils understand what a microcontroller is and its role in everyday devices.  
- Pupils can explain the concept of **Input → Process → Output**.  
- Pupils can use MakeCode to create a simple program and upload it to a micro:bit.  
- Pupils feel welcomed into the club community and understand expectations.  

---

## Detailed Lesson Plan (≈90 minutes)

**1) Welcome & Icebreaker (10 min)**  
- Introduce yourself and the club vision (*“We make things that think!”*).  
- Icebreaker question: *“What’s the coolest gadget you’ve used today?”*  
- Quick demo: press button A on a micro:bit → show a smiley.

**2) Club Rules & How We Work (10 min)**  
- Rules: respect equipment, collaborate, mistakes = learning.  
- Introduce pair programming roles (Driver/Navigator).  
- Demonstrate safe handling of USB cables and devices.

**3) What is a Microcontroller? (10 min)**  
- Show the micro:bit.  
- Analogy: *“It’s a brain for gadgets — like in washing machines, cars, toys.”*  
- Draw the **Input → Process → Output** diagram.  
- Pupils suggest examples of inputs (buttons, sensors) and outputs (lights, sounds).

**4) MakeCode Tour (15 min)**  
- Open [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org).  
- Show block categories, simulator, and how to create a new project.  
- Demonstrate download → upload to micro:bit.  
- Support pupils in logging in and flashing their first test program.

**5) First Program — Digital Name Badge (25 min)**  
- Pupils program the LEDs to scroll their name.  
- Add button A = smiley, button B = heart.  
- Extension: A+B shows a custom pattern.  
- Stretch: dice roller using `pick random 1–6` + display number.  
- Encourage debugging and peer support.

**6) Reflection & Wrap-Up (15 min)**  
- Share programs with a neighbour (show names/badges).  
- Ask: *“What’s an input? What’s an output?”*  
- Quick exit question: *“How did your micro:bit process your instructions?”*  
- Tease Week 2: Dice Roller.

## Differentiation
- **New coders:** provide a partially-completed project in MakeCode (starter blocks already in place).  
- **Experienced coders:** challenge them with dice roller or animation patterns.  
- Allow mixed-ability pairing — encourage peer teaching.  

---

## Assessment
- Observe if pupils can:  
  - Explain the Input → Process → Output chain.  
  - Successfully upload a program to the micro:bit.  
  - Debug simple issues independently or with guidance.  

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Micro:bit won’t flash:**  
  - Check cable (some are charge-only).  
  - Try a different USB port.  
  - Use WebUSB option in MakeCode.  
- **Name doesn’t scroll:**  
  - Ensure text is inside `on start`.  
  - Check that blocks are attached, not floating.  
- **Buttons don’t work:**  
  - Confirm code is inside `on button pressed` blocks.  

---

## Materials & Setup
- BBC micro:bits (1 per child or pair).  
- USB cables (data-capable).  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Projector for demo.  
- Optional: printed badge templates for design extension.  
- Spare kit: extra cables, spare devices, printed quick-start cards.

---

## Safety & Safeguarding Notes
- Cable strain — show pupils how to insert/remove gently.  
- Ensure devices are collected at end and stored properly.  
- Reinforce behaviour expectations: teamwork, safe sharing.  
- Check photo permissions before taking any pictures.

## Reflection (for leader)
- Note pupil confidence levels (especially new members).  
- Record common troubleshooting issues for improvement in Week 2.  
- Identify pupils who could mentor peers in future sessions.
