# Instructor Notes — Week 2
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Align, Group, Holes  
**Focus Concept:** Combining shapes precisely with align, group and holes  
**Mini-Project:** *Stamp or Cutter (not for real food)*  

---

## Learning Objectives
- Use this week’s focus tools effectively to model a simple product.  
- Explain design choices using correct vocabulary (e.g. size, symmetry, tolerance).  
- Iterate designs based on testing or peer feedback.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment | Time | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| Welcome & recap | 10 min | Recap Autumn and introduce today’s focus |
| Tool demo | 10 min | Model the new tools with a short example |
| Guided build | 25 min | Scaffold the mini-project step by step |
| Independent make | 25 min | Personalise, refine and extend designs |
| Share & tidy | 10 min | Quick gallery, feedback and saving work |

---

## Part A — Explore & Demo
- Demonstrate today’s tools with a very small example (e.g. one corner of the final project).  
- Highlight common pitfalls, such as tiny features that will not print well or awkward print orientations.  

## Part B — Guided Build
- Lead the group through building a minimal viable product (MVP) that meets the week’s brief.  
- Pause after key steps so participants can catch up and you can check understanding.  

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend
- Ask learners to personalise their designs or add one extra feature.  
- Offer simple extension ideas for quick finishers (extra details, improved strength, extra patterns, etc.).  

---

## Vocabulary for This Week
Words to emphasise in explanations and on the board: Align, Group, Ungroup, Hole, Solid, Boolean operation.

---

## Instructor Tips
- Use a visual timer or simple “halfway” reminder so the group leaves enough time to finish and save.  
- Encourage learners to rotate their view often to check designs from more than one angle.  
- For trickier weeks (mechanisms, Codeblocks, circuits), consider short paired explanations before independent work.  
- Keep a print queue list with model names and initials so pupils can track when their designs will be printed.  

---

## Assessment & Reflection
- Can learners name and demonstrate the focus tools for the week?  
- Do their models broadly match the design brief (e.g. fit size, stability, readability)?  
- Can they describe at least one change they made after testing or feedback?  

> Prompt: “What did you change in your design and why did it make it better?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception | Clarification |
|---------------|---------------|
| “Thin parts are always fine if they look cool.” | Thin walls and tiny details can break easily or fail to print; strengthen or thicken where possible. |
| “If it looks OK from one side, it will print fine.” | Check all sides and think about overhangs and supports before exporting. |
| “Undo will always rescue me.” | Encourage regular saving and copying so experimental changes don’t lose the best version. |

---

## Differentiation
- **Beginners:** Follow the guided steps closely; limit changes to colours, simple decorations or one extra feature.  
- **Confident learners:** Add extra functional details (handles, fillets, mirrored parts, parameter changes).  
- **Stretch:** Create variants for different users (e.g. a smaller tag for a younger sibling, a heavier base for stability).

## Cross-Curricular Links

| Subject | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| **Maths** | Measurement in millimetres, symmetry, angles, simple scaling. |
| **Art & Design** | Composition, colour, balance, and use of pattern or motif. |
| **Science/Engineering** | Structures, forces, friction, mechanisms and material strength. |
| **Computing** | Digital content creation and, in Week 8, block-based programming for parametric design. |

## KS2 Curriculum Mapping

| Strand | Evidence in Session |
|--------|----------------------|
| KS2 Computing — Creating Media (3D) | Using a digital tool to create 3D content and discuss audience and purpose. |
| KS2 Computing — Programming (Week 8) | Using Codeblocks loops and parameters to generate geometry. |
| KS2 D&T — Design | Developing and communicating ideas that are fit for a simple brief. |
| KS2 D&T — Make | Selecting virtual tools and techniques; measuring and aligning accurately. |
| KS2 D&T — Evaluate | Reflecting on designs and suggesting improvements. |
| KS2 D&T — Technical Knowledge | Understanding simple mechanisms, structures and print-related constraints. |

---

## Materials & Setup
- Computers with internet and Tinkercad accounts (one per participant or one between two).  
- Mice for easier navigation wherever possible.  
- Optional: card or scrap paper for quick sketching of ideas.  
- Adult-supervised 3D printer if prints will be prepared.  
- Whiteboard or flipchart for vocabulary and the print queue.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding
- Only adults or trained staff should operate slicing software and 3D printers.  
- Avoid printing items that are too small, sharp or could be swallowed; follow school policies.  
- Encourage sensible posture at computers and short movement breaks where appropriate.
