# Instructor Notes — Week 2
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Align & Group (Character Design)  
**Focus Concept:** Placing and combining shapes accurately  
**Mini-Project:** *Simple Character*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use the **align** tool to centre and line up features.  
- **Group** shapes so that characters move as a single model.  
- Design a simple character token with clear, expressive features.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                      |
|-------------------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| Recap & warm-up   | 10   | Week 1 navigation; introduce characters    |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Align + group using eyes on a face         |
| Guided build      | 25   | Build a basic character step by step       |
| Independent make  | 25   | Personalise, add features and accessories  |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Quick gallery, feedback and save           |

---

## Part A — Recap & Tool Demo

- Recap: orbit, pan, zoom and placing shapes.  
- Demonstrate:
  - Building a simple “face” plate.  
  - Adding two “eyes” and using **align** to centre them horizontally.  
  - Grouping the face and eyes so they move together.  

Highlight that align is about **accuracy**, not guessing.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: Simple Character

Suggested sequence:

1. Create a main body shape (e.g. cylinder or box).  
2. Add features: eyes, mouth, optional arms/ears.  
3. Use **align** for eye placement or to centre features on the body.  
4. **Group** main parts so the character can be moved easily.  

Encourage a limited palette of features first; extra detail can come later.

---

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend

- Learners extend their character: hats, badges, small tools, etc.  
- If time, some may create a **second character** to go with the first (e.g. friend, pet, sidekick).  

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Align** — line shapes up along edges or centres.  
- **Group** — join shapes into a single object.  
- **Symmetry** — when both sides of something look the same.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Show align slowly; it is easy for children to miss which arrows they clicked.  
- Encourage “simple but clear” characters — too many tiny details can be frustrating.  
- For learners who rush, challenge them to refine: “Can you make the eyes exactly level?”  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Use of **align** to position eyes or other features.  
- Grouped components that move together.  
- Characters that are readable from multiple angles (not just front-on).

> Prompt: “If I rotate your character, does it still look good from the side?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                           | Clarification / Strategy                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| “I moved one eye, now they don’t match” | Use **undo** and then use align again more carefully.    |
| Confusing align with move               | Emphasise that align is about lining things up precisely.|
| Grouping everything too early           | Suggest grouping in stages (face, then body, etc.).      |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Provide a starting template (body shape already in place).  
  - Focus on two or three well-placed features.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Add accessories (e.g. backpack, tool, pet).  
  - Create a pair or trio of characters that belong together.

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  
- Optional printed examples of simple characters for inspiration.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- Encourage appropriate, kind character themes.  
- Avoid designs that could be interpreted as unkind or targeting others.
