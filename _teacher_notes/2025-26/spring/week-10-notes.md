# Instructor Notes — Week 10
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Final Project (Structured Choice)  
**Focus Concept:** Planning, improving and presenting a chosen design  
**Mini-Project:** *Improved Car / Tower / Rocket*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Choose a project focus (car, tower or rocket / revolved form).  
- Plan and implement at least one meaningful improvement.  
- Present the final design and explain how it has improved over time.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                           |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Recap & options   | 10   | Review term, explain project choices           |
| Planning          | 10   | Quick sketch/plan of improvements              |
| Build & refine    | 40   | Main working time on chosen project            |
| Optional testing  | 10   | SimLab tests for cars/towers where relevant    |
| Share & reflect   | 10   | Short presentations and feedback               |

---

## Part A — Recap & Choice

- Briefly revisit the main themes of the term:
  - 3D basics, alignment, holes, symmetry, Sketch & Revolve.  
  - Motion and friction in SimLab.  
  - Stability and bracing for towers.  
- Present the three options clearly:
  - **Car:** focus on motion, shape and smooth movement.  
  - **Tower:** focus on stability and earthquake survival.  
  - **Rocket / Revolved object:** focus on clean design and practicality.  

Ask each learner to pick **one** and state a simple goal (e.g. “make my car roll straighter”).

---

## Part B — Build, Refine & Test

- Most of the session is devoted to:
  - Re-opening a previous model or starting a refined version from scratch.  
  - Making targeted changes based on what they learned.  
- For cars and towers:
  - Use **SimLab** where possible to test improvements.  
- For rockets/pendants:
  - Check thickness, proportions and details for a plausible, printable design.

Remind learners to save versions as they go, especially if making big changes.

---

## Part C — Sharing & Reflection

- Invite quick, informal presentations (30–60 seconds each):
  - Which project they chose.  
  - What they changed.  
  - What difference it made.  
- Encourage peers to give kind, specific feedback (“I like how you…”, “Have you thought about…?”).

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Iterate** — make repeated improvements to a design.  
- **Prototype** — an early version of something used for testing.  
- **Brief** — a short description of what a design should do or be like.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Keep the focus on **quality of thinking** and improvement, not complexity.  
- Gently steer over-ambitious ideas back to manageable goals for the available time.  
- Consider taking screenshots or exports for a term-end display or online gallery.  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Evidence of thoughtful planning before jumping into changes.  
- Clear improvement compared with earlier versions.  
- Ability to explain design decisions in relation to motion or stability.

> Prompt: “If you had another week, what would you do next with this design?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                          | Clarification / Strategy                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| “Starting over is always bad”          | Frame restart as sometimes the best way to improve.      |
| Only big, flashy changes count         | Emphasise that **small, smart changes** can be powerful. |
| SimLab results don’t matter            | Link test outcomes directly to design improvements.      |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - May simply tidy and slightly refine an existing model.  
  - Focus on one clear improvement and explaining it.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Attempt more significant re-designs.  
  - Combine features from more than one earlier project.

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  
- Optional: display board or digital folder for final screenshots.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- Ensure final designs are appropriate and safe to print or share.  
- Maintain a positive, supportive atmosphere during presentations.
