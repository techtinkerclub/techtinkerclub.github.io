# Instructor Notes — Week 4
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Duplicate, Patterns & Basic Mirror  
**Focus Concept:** Creating repetition and symmetry in 3D  
**Mini-Project:** *Symmetric Creature or Rocket*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use **duplicate** to make repeated elements quickly.  
- Use **mirror** to create simple bilateral symmetry.  
- Design a creature or rocket that looks balanced and stable.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                          |
|-------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Review holes, characters and stamps           |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Duplicate and mirror on a simple model        |
| Guided build      | 25   | Build a symmetric creature/rocket skeleton    |
| Independent make  | 25   | Add patterns and refine details               |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Show symmetry and talk through designs        |

---

## Part A — Demo: Duplicate & Mirror

- Demonstrate:
  - Making one fin/arm/eye, then **duplicating** it.  
  - Using **mirror** to flip the duplicate to the other side of the body.  
- Show how changing one side does **not** automatically change the other — mirror is a one-time flip, not a live link.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: Symmetric Creature or Rocket

Suggested sequence:

1. Create a central body shape (rocket fuselage or creature torso).  
2. Add one side feature (fin, arm, ear, booster).  
3. Duplicate and mirror that feature across the appropriate axis.  
4. Use align if needed to centre features correctly.  

Talk about where the **line of symmetry** could be drawn.

---

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend

- Learners choose whether they’re making a creature or rocket.  
- They add:
  - Repeated decorative elements (spots, windows, stripes).  
  - Optional small base or stand for stability.  

Invite them to check the model from several angles and adjust.

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Duplicate** — make an exact copy of a selected object.  
- **Mirror** — flip an object over a chosen axis.  
- **Axis** — the line the mirror uses to flip objects.  
- **Symmetry** — when both sides mirror each other.

---

## Instructor Tips

- Clearly point out which axis you’re mirroring across — children often click the wrong one.  
- Encourage them not to overdo decoration: start simple, then add detail if time allows.  
- For those who struggle with mirroring, allow them to manually copy and position parts but still discuss symmetry.

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Use of duplicate and mirror to create matching pairs.  
- Designs that are roughly balanced (not all mass on one side).  
- An ability to point out their line of symmetry.

> Prompt: “If I cut your rocket/creature down the middle, would both sides match?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                         | Clarification / Strategy                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| “Mirror didn’t work”                  | Check axis choice; demonstrate again on a simple shape. |
| Mirroring after moving the copy      | Encourage mirroring **before** shifting the duplicate.  |
| Overloaded with small repeated parts | Suggest choosing one or two repeating motifs only.      |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Start from a provided central body shape.  
  - Focus on one or two mirrored features only.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Add multiple layers of repetition (windows, panels, decorations).  
  - Experiment with slightly asymmetric “damage” or detail while keeping the main shape balanced.

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  
- Optional: reference images of rockets, animals or characters.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- For eventual printing, avoid sharp spikes or fragile thin parts.  
- Encourage designs that are positive and school-appropriate.
