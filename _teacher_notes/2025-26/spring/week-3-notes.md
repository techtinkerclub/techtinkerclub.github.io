# Instructor Notes — Week 3
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Holes & Negative Space  
**Focus Concept:** Cutting shapes away to create stamps and cut-outs  
**Mini-Project:** *Simple Stamp / Cutter*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use **hole shapes** to remove material from solids.  
- Understand **negative space** as the “empty shape” that appears.  
- Design a simple stamp or cutter with a clear, recognisable motif.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                          |
|-------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Week 1–2 tools; introduce holes & cut-outs    |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Turn shapes into holes, group to cut          |
| Guided build      | 25   | Create a basic stamp / cutter                 |
| Independent make  | 25   | Personal motifs and extra details             |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Show designs; discuss clarity and strength    |

---

## Part A — Demo: From Solid to Stamp

- Start with a simple box as a “stamp base”.  
- Add a letter or symbol shape on top and convert it to a **hole**.  
- **Group** the base and hole to show the cut-out.  
- Orbit around so everyone can see that the shape is now **missing material**, not just coloured differently.

Emphasise that holes only cut when grouped with solids.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: Basic Stamp / Cutter

Suggested sequence:

1. Base: flat box, sized sensibly.  
2. Motif: a simple letter, digit, or icon placed on top.  
3. Convert motif to **hole**; adjust depth if needed.  
4. Group base + hole; check from several angles.  

Discuss which motifs work best: simple, bold shapes rather than tiny details.

---

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend

- Learners design their own stamp: initials, logo, or simple picture.  
- Extensions may include:
  - A handle on the back.  
  - A border or frame.  
  - Two-part sets (e.g. a pair of stamps that go together).  

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Hole** — a shape that removes material when grouped with a solid.  
- **Negative Space** — the empty shape left behind after cutting.  
- **Clearance** — enough space around details so they show clearly.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Encourage **simplicity**: bold shapes work far better than intricate patterns for young makers.  
- Rotate models during discussions so pupils develop a strong 3D sense of the cut-outs.  
- Link to real-world examples: cookie cutters, rubber stamps, embossing tools.  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Appropriate use of hole vs solid.  
- Grouped models where the cut-out makes sense visually.  
- An ability to talk about why some designs are clearer than others.

> Prompt: “If we printed this, would the picture be easy to see? Why or why not?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                             | Clarification / Strategy                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Changing colour makes a hole”            | Holes are a specific setting; show the striped appearance.|
| Forgetting to group after creating holes  | Remind: **hole + solid + group = cut-out**.               |
| Overcrowded designs with tiny cut-outs    | Encourage larger shapes and fewer details.                |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Choose from pre-made motif shapes (heart, star, single letter).  
  - Focus on one clear cut-out only.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Combine two or more motifs (e.g. letter and symbol).  
  - Experiment with different depths of cut and layered stamps.

|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Computing — Creating Media (3D)       | Designing 3D artefacts with cut-outs.                   |
| D&T — Design                          | Designing for a visual effect (clear motif).            |
| D&T — Make                            | Using tools to shape and join (group) digital parts.    |
| D&T — Evaluate                        | Comparing clarity and robustness of different designs.  |

---

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  
- Optionally: physical examples of stamps/cutters to show.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- If any objects are eventually printed, ensure they are not small enough to be choking hazards.  
- Avoid designs that imitate harmful or unsafe tools.
