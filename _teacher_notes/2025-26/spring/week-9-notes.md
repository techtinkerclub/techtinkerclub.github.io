# Instructor Notes — Week 9
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Structure & Stability (SimLab Earthquake)  
**Focus Concept:** Building towers that can withstand shaking  
**Mini-Project:** *Anti-Fall Tower Challenge*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Build a simple tower structure in SimLab using beams and connectors.  
- Test the tower with earthquake simulations.  
- Strengthen the design using wider bases and **bracing**.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                           |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Review motion tests; introduce towers & quakes |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Build a basic tower; run a gentle quake        |
| Guided build      | 25   | Everyone builds a first-attempt tower          |
| Independent refine| 25   | Bracing, widening base, re-testing             |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Compare “before” and “after” towers           |

---

## Part A — Demo: Wobbly vs Braced Tower

- Build a quick, tall, **thin** tower with minimal support.  
- Run a low-level earthquake simulation and watch it fail.  
- Add **bracing** (diagonal members) and widen the base.  
- Run the same simulation and compare.

Link this to real-world buildings and bridges.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: First Towers

- Set a brief:  
  - Minimum height (e.g. 3 or 4 “storeys”).  
  - No grouping everything into one solid (we want realistic behaviour).  
- Let learners build a basic tower and run a first earthquake test.  
- Ask them to identify which parts failed first.

---

## Part C — Independent Strengthening & Challenge

- Learners improve their towers by:
  - Adding diagonal braces.  
  - Widening the footprint.  
  - Thickening critical parts.  
- If time allows, run a friendly challenge:
  - Increase the quake strength gradually.  
  - See which towers survive longest, while recognising that “failure” shows where they can improve.

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Stability** — how well something stays upright.  
- **Bracing** — diagonal supports that stop wobbling.  
- **Base** — the part of the structure that sits on the ground.  
- **Earthquake** — shaking of the ground that can damage buildings.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Be sensitive: earthquakes can be a scary or lived topic for some children.  
- Emphasise that this is a **safe simulation** to help engineers design safer real buildings.  
- Encourage changes one at a time, so pupils see what each addition does.

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Evidence of design changes that improve stability.  
- Pupils able to point to braces or base changes and explain their function.  
- Use of terms like “wider base”, “bracing”, “top-heavy”.

> Prompt: “What did you change after the first test, and how did it help your tower?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                             | Clarification / Strategy                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Taller is always better”                 | Discuss trade-off: taller is harder to stabilise.          |
| Adding mass at the top improves strength  | Show that top-heavy towers topple more easily.             |
| Braces anywhere work the same             | Compare random vs well-placed diagonal supports.           |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Build shorter towers with explicit guidance on where to add braces.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Attempt taller towers; compare different bracing patterns.  
  - Explain their design as if presenting to a client or engineer.

## KS2 Curriculum Mapping

| Strand                                | Evidence in Session                                      |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Science — Working Scientifically      | Predicting, testing, observing, and improving designs.  |
| D&T — Technical Knowledge             | Understanding how structures can be strengthened.       |
| Computing — Modelling & Simulation    | Using digital simulations to explore “what if?”         |

---

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- Handle earthquake topics with care and sensitivity.  
- Encourage supportive, non-competitive language when towers fail.
