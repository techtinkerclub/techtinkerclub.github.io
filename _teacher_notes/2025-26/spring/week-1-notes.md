# Instructor Notes — Week 1
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** 3D Basics & Navigation  
**Focus Concept:** Moving in 3D space, placing and resizing simple shapes  
**Mini-Project:** *Name Tag / Keyring*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Introduce Tinkercad and the idea of a **3D workspace**.  
- Practise **orbit**, **pan** and **zoom** to view objects from different angles.  
- Place and resize basic shapes on the **workplane**.  
- Combine a base and text to make a simple, readable name tag or keyring.

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                      |
|-------------------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| Welcome & setup   | 10   | Logins, what is Tinkercad, term overview   |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Orbit, pan, zoom, place & resize shapes    |
| Guided build      | 25   | Step-by-step name tag / keyring            |
| Independent make  | 25   | Personalise designs                        |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Quick gallery, saving, and recap          |

## Part A — Introduction & Demo

- Briefly explain that Tinkercad is a **3D design tool** and that this term is about **design, test, improve**.  
- Demonstrate:
  - Using the **view cube** and mouse (or trackpad) to orbit.  
  - **Pan** and **zoom**.  
  - Dropping a basic shape onto the workplane and resizing it.  
- Emphasise that it’s normal to feel a bit “lost” in 3D at first — home view and the view cube help them reset.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: Name Tag / Keyring

Suggested sequence (you can adapt live):

1. Place a flat shape (e.g. box) and resize it to a sensible tag size (e.g. 50–70 mm long).  
2. Add a **text** shape with the learner’s name or initials; scale to fit the base.  
3. Optional: add a small cylinder or hole near the edge for a keyring.  
4. Show how to change colours (not essential for printing but motivating).  

Encourage participants to check their design from multiple angles.

---

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend

- Invite learners to add **one or two** decorations only (small icon, border) without over-complicating.  
- If time allows, some may start a second variant (e.g. tag for a sibling or pet).  

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

Write key terms on the board and refer back to them:

- **Orbit** — move the camera around the model to see from different sides.  
- **Pan** — slide the camera left/right/up/down.  
- **Zoom** — move closer to or further from the model.  
- **Workplane** — the flat area where shapes are placed and edited.  
- **Group** (preview) — join shapes together so they behave as one object.

---

## Instructor Tips

- If many are new to 3D, keep the demo **slow and explicit**, naming each action as you do it.  
- Encourage “hands off the mouse while I’m demoing” for short moments so they can see clearly.  
- For mixed-ability groups, invite confident learners to support peers with navigation, not design.  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Can learners reliably orbit, pan and zoom to inspect their model?  
- Do they understand that the workplane is like a “table” where they build?  
- Can they explain who their name tag is for and why they chose its size or style?

> Prompt: “Show me your tag from the side — what do you notice? Is it too thick, too thin, or OK?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                                | Clarification / Strategy                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| “I’ve lost my model; it’s gone!”             | Use **home view** or click the model in the object list.      |
| “2D thinking” — only looking from above      | Encourage orbiting around; ask them to show you side views.   |
| Making tags extremely tiny or huge           | Compare to a real tag size in cm/mm; adjust scale together.   |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Focus on basic navigation and a very simple rectangular tag.  
  - Provide a template base they can reuse.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Experiment with rounded or unusual base shapes.  
  - Add a second line of text or a small icon.

## Cross-Curricular Links

| Subject          | Connection                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Computing**    | Creating digital 3D content for a specific purpose.         |
| **Maths**        | Informal use of measurement and proportional resizing.      |
| **Art & Design** | Colour and composition of the tag; personal symbolism.      |
| **PSHE**         | Identity and ownership (tags for self, family, or community)|

## KS2 Curriculum Mapping

| Strand                                | Evidence in Session                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Computing — Creating Media (3D)       | Designing and editing a simple 3D artefact.          |
| D&T — Design                          | Designing a product for themselves or a specific user.|
| D&T — Make                            | Selecting tools to shape and combine components.     |
| D&T — Evaluate                        | Discussing whether the tag is readable and practical.|

---

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- One **mouse per device** is strongly recommended.  
- Projector or large display for live demo.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- Online safety: remind learners that they should not share personal logins.  
- 3D printing (if used later): only adults handle slicing software and printers.  
- Encourage kind, positive comments when looking at each other’s designs.
