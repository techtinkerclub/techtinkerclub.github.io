# Instructor Notes — Week 8
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Make the Car Move (SimLab)  
**Focus Concept:** Testing car designs in a simulated environment  
**Mini-Project:** *Car Motion Test & Improvements*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Set up a simple **SimLab** scene using a car body and ramp.  
- Observe how car shape and ramp angle affect motion.  
- Make at least one clear improvement based on testing.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                           |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Review Week 7 car designs; SimLab reminder     |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Bring car into SimLab; build basic ramp scene  |
| Guided tests      | 20   | Run first motion tests and discuss results     |
| Independent tests | 30   | Tuning car shape and ramp setups               |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Compare distances and improvements             |

---

## Part A — Demo: Car on a Ramp

- Show a simple car-like block on a ramp in SimLab.  
- Run a test and look for:
  - Does it slide straight or veer to one side?  
  - Does it tip forward or backward?  
- Change a small aspect (e.g. ramp angle or car nose shape) and run again.

Connect behaviour to shape and friction, rather than just “luck”.

---

## Part B — Guided Motion Tests

- Learners import or quickly rebuild a simplified version of their Week 7 car body.  
- Set up:
  - A straight ramp.  
  - A flat ground plane.  
- Run several tests and observe:
  - How far the car travels.  
  - Whether it stays upright.  

Encourage them to **change only one thing at a time** when testing.

---

## Part C — Independent Improvements & Challenges

- Pupils adjust their cars or ramps to improve performance:
  - Lowering the centre of mass.  
  - Smoothing the front.  
  - Adjusting ramp steepness.  
- Optional challenge:
  - “Whose car goes furthest without flipping?”  

Focus on reasoning: **why** did they choose each change?

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Simulation** — a computer-based model of how something moves or behaves.  
- **Friction** — force that slows motion between touching surfaces.  
- **Centre of mass** — the “balance point” of an object.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Keep cars relatively **simple** to avoid complex, unpredictable behaviour.  
- Use repeated tests and ask pupils to predict before each run.  
- If time is short, provide a shared ramp design that everyone uses.  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Correct use of SimLab tools to run controlled tests.  
- At least one thoughtful design change justified by evidence.  
- Improved motion (straighter travel, less flipping) where possible.

> Prompt: “What was wrong with your first car, and what did you do to make it better?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                         | Clarification / Strategy                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| “The car is cursed / random!”         | Show that same setup gives same result; change one factor. |
| Bigger always means better            | Explain that heavier or bulkier may worsen stability.      |
| Steepest ramp is always best          | Discuss trade-off: too steep can cause flipping.           |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Use teacher-provided ramp and simple car body.  
  - Focus on one change (e.g. ramp angle).  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Design more complex courses (bumps, gentle curves).  
  - Log results (distance, number of flips) informally.

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- As with Week 6, handle crash/accident language sensitively.  
- Emphasise respectful competition if running distance challenges.
