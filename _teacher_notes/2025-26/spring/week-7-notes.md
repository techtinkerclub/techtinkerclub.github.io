# Instructor Notes — Week 7
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** CAD: Design a Simple Car Body  
**Focus Concept:** Combining 3D tools into one purposeful vehicle design  
**Mini-Project:** *4-Wheel Car Design*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use align, group, holes, duplicate and mirror together in one project.  
- Design a car body that clearly shows where four wheels would go.  
- Keep the model roughly symmetric and stable for later testing.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                           |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Review SimLab motion; introduce car design     |
| Planning          | 10   | Sketch or discuss car ideas and constraints    |
| Guided build      | 25   | Build a simple chassis and wheel arches        |
| Independent make  | 25   | Refine, decorate and adjust proportions        |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Show designs; discuss where wheels will be     |

---

## Part A — Planning & Constraints

- Explain that this week is about a **car body only** (no detailed wheels yet).  
- Mention simple constraints:
  - Enough space for 4 wheels.  
  - Fairly symmetric left–right.  
  - Flat enough bottom so it would sit or roll on a surface.  
- Invite quick sketching on paper or talk through designs in pairs.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: Car Body

Suggested sequence:

1. Create a rectangular chassis block in sensible proportions.  
2. Use **holes** to cut out simple wheel arches or gaps for wheel positions.  
3. Use **duplicate + mirror** for left/right wheel openings.  
4. Round or adjust the front and back using extra shapes.

Keep the design simple and clear, rather than extremely detailed.

---

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend

- Learners refine:
  - Cabin shape, windows, roof.  
  - Simple bumper or spoiler.  
- Encourage them to check that:
  - The car still has space for wheels.  
  - The underside is not too bumpy to roll.  

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Chassis** — main frame or body of a vehicle.  
- **Wheelbase** — distance between front and rear wheel positions.  
- **Symmetry** — similar shape on both sides of a centre line.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Use side-view screenshots or real toy cars as a reference.  
- Remind learners that **function comes first**, then decoration.  
- If time is short, you can provide a starter chassis and focus on wheel arch placement.

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Clear, consistent wheel positions on both sides.  
- Designs that resemble a car, not an unstructured block.  
- Pupils who can explain why their car might move smoothly or not.

> Prompt: “Show me where your wheels would go. How did that affect your design?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                                | Clarification / Strategy                             |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Wheels “floating” in mid-air                  | Emphasise contact with ground and proper arches.     |
| Very narrow or unstable body                  | Encourage widening the chassis for better stability. |
| Forgetting symmetry                           | Use mirror and align to tidy up left and right.      |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Start from a teacher-provided chassis block.  
  - Focus mainly on wheel arches and a simple roof.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Experiment with different car types (racing car vs. minibus).  
  - Add subtle design details while preserving function.

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  
- Optional: a few toy cars for reference.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- If printing any bodies, follow the same safety rules on size and sharpness.  
- Encourage respectful feedback between learners when comparing designs.
