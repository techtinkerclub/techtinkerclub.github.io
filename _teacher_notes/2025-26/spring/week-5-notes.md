# Instructor Notes — Week 5
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Shape Generators & Scribble  
**Focus Concept:** Custom forms with shape generators and doodle-to-3D  
**Mini-Project:** *Custom Badge or Ornament*  

---

## Learning Objectives
- Use the focus tools effectively to model a simple product.
- Explain choices using correct vocabulary (size, symmetry, tolerance).
- Iterate designs based on testing or peer feedback.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)


| Segment | Time | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| Welcome & Tools Demo | 15 min | Workspace tour and focus concept |
| Guided Build | 30 min | Mini-project (scaffolded) |
| Independent Make | 20 min | Personalise / extend |
| Share & Reflect | 10 min | Peer feedback and gallery |
| Tidy & Close | 5 min | Save/export and queue prints |


---

## Part A — Explore & Demo
- Demo today’s tools with a small example model.
- Highlight common pitfalls and show a “good” orientation for printing.

## Part B — Guided Build
- Step-by-step to achieve a minimal viable product (MVP) for the brief.
- Pause after key steps for quick check-ins.

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend
- Learners personalise and add features.
- Offer optional stretch goals for fast finishers.

---

## Instructor Tips
- Use a visual timer to keep the pace; stop for short, whole-group showcases.
- Encourage sketch-first for tricky models (30–60 seconds thumbnail).
- Mouse use makes a big difference; pair up to share if needed.
- Keep a print queue board with model names and owner initials.

---

## Assessment & Reflection
- Can learners name and demonstrate the focus tools?
- Do models meet the brief (size fit, readable base, stable structure)?
- Are pupils iterating based on feedback (at least one improvement)?

> Prompt: “What changed between version 1 and version 2? Why?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception | Clarification |
|---------------|---------------|
| “Bigger grid = bigger model.” | The grid is a ruler; model size depends on part dimensions. |
| “Walls can be paper thin.” | Thin parts may fail; aim for ~1.2–2.0 mm minimum where possible. |
| “Supports are free.” | Supports cost time and can mark surfaces; prefer good orientation. |

---

## Differentiation
- **Beginners:** Copy teacher model, then change colours/text only.
- **Confident:** Add features (fillets/chamfers, patterned cut-outs).  
- **Stretch:** Parametric/Codeblocks (Week 8), or multi-part assemblies.

---

## Cross-Curricular Links

| Subject | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| **Maths** | Measurement, units, symmetry, simple ratios. |
| **Art & Design** | Composition, colour, symmetry, surface detail. |
| **Science/Engineering** | Strength, stability, moving parts, friction. |
| **Computing** | Digital creation; parametric thinking (Week 8). |

---

## KS2 Curriculum Mapping

| Strand | Evidence in Session |
|--------|----------------------|
| KS2 Computing — Creating Media (3D) | Using a digital tool to create 3D content and discuss audience & purpose. |
| KS2 Computing — Programming (Week 8) | Codeblocks loops/parameters to generate geometry. |
| KS2 D&T — Design | Develop and communicate ideas; consider user and purpose. |
| KS2 D&T — Make | Select tools/techniques; measure and “cut” (virtually) accurately. |
| KS2 D&T — Evaluate | Evaluate their own designs and suggest improvements. |
| KS2 D&T — Technical Knowledge | Understand how structures/mechanisms strengthen products; tolerances for fit. |

---

## Materials & Setup
- Computers with internet and Tinkercad accounts
- Optional: card/paper for sketching ideas
- 3D printer supervised by adults (for selected models)
- Whiteboard for print queue and tips

---

## Safety & Safeguarding
- Only adults handle slicing/printing and hot equipment.
- Avoid tiny, swallowable prints; follow school policy.
- Promote good posture and short eye breaks.
