# Instructor Notes — Week 5
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Sketch & Revolve (2D → 3D)  
**Focus Concept:** Turning profile sketches into smooth 3D forms  
**Mini-Project:** *Revolved Rocket / Pendant*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use the **Sketch** tool to create simple, closed profile shapes.  
- Apply **Revolve** to turn a 2D profile into a 3D object.  
- Adjust proportions and thickness for a practical, printable design.

---

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                           |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Review symmetry; introduce Sketch & Revolve    |
| Tool demo         | 15   | Draw a profile and revolve into a 3D cup/rocket|
| Guided build      | 25   | Learners create their own profile + revolve    |
| Independent make  | 20   | Refinements, extra details                     |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Show profile and final 3D form                 |

---

## Part A — Demo: From Profile to 3D

- Demonstrate:
  - Opening **Sketch** and drawing a simple side-view profile (half of a cup or rocket).  
  - Ensuring the outline is **closed** (no gaps).  
  - Using **Revolve** to spin the profile around an axis.  
- Rotate the final 3D object and show how the 2D outline determined its shape.

---

## Part B — Guided Build: Revolved Rocket / Pendant

Suggested sequence:

1. Ask learners to decide: rocket body, bottle, cup, or pendant.  
2. Guide them through drawing a neat profile, emphasising:
   - Start and end on the axis line.  
   - Avoiding overly spiky or thin sections.  
3. Use **Revolve** and adjust angle and axis if needed.  
4. Discuss whether the shape would **stand up**, be comfortable to hold, or look balanced.

---

## Part C — Independent Make & Extend

- Learners refine their forms and optionally add:
  - Fins or base (for rockets).  
  - A loop (for pendants).  
  - A thicker base or lip (for cups/bottles).  

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **Sketch** — a 2D drawing used as the basis for a 3D object.  
- **Profile** — the outline you revolve.  
- **Revolve** — spin a profile around an axis.  
- **Axis** — the line that stays still during the spin.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Keep first examples **very simple**; complex outlines make it harder to see what’s happening.  
- Warn that spiky or hair-thin features are problematic for printing.  
- Encourage zooming in while sketching to join lines accurately.  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Closed profiles that revolve correctly.  
- Sensible proportions (not absurdly tall/thin or top-heavy).  
- An ability to connect the 2D outline with the 3D result.

> Prompt: “Show me where your profile line is on this finished rocket/cup.”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                         | Clarification / Strategy                                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gaps in the sketch cause odd results | Zoom in and close all gaps; revolve only closed profiles. |
| Revolving around the wrong axis      | Try each axis in turn; explain which direction is best.   |
| Over-complicated outlines            | Encourage starting with 3–5 simple segments, then refine. |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Stick to a simple cup or short bottle profile.  
  - Use teacher-modelled profile as a starting point.  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Design a more stylised rocket or pendant.  
  - Experiment with subtle curves and shoulders in the profile.

## Materials & Setup

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts.  
- Mouse per device.  
- Example pictures of bottles, cups, rockets, pendants.  

---

## Safety & Safeguarding

- For printed objects, consider school policies (no sharp, weapon-like shapes).  
- Encourage appropriate wearables (pendants etc.), safe for school.
