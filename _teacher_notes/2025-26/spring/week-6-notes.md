# Instructor Notes — Week 6
{% include print-to-pdf.html %}

**Theme:** Motion, Gravity & Friction (SimLab)  
**Focus Concept:** Observing how shapes move on ramps and surfaces  
**Mini-Project:** *Sliding & Rolling Experiments*

---

## Learning Objectives

- Open and run a simple **SimLab** physics simulation.  
- Compare how different shapes (cubes, cylinders, spheres) **slide or roll**.  
- Describe the effect of ramp steepness and surface on motion in simple language.

## Session Flow (≈ 80 min)

| Segment           | Time | Focus                                           |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Recap & intro     | 10   | Review 3D forms; introduce SimLab              |
| Tool demo         | 10   | Build a basic ramp test in SimLab              |
| Guided experiment | 25   | Test different shapes and ramp angles          |
| Independent tests | 25   | Custom ramps and mini “races”                  |
| Share & tidy      | 10   | Compare results and key observations           |

---

## Part A — Demo: First SimLab Scene

- Show how to open a design in **SimLab** (or start a simple new scene).  
- Build a straightforward **ramp** with a block at the top and ground at the bottom.  
- Ask learners to **predict** what will happen, then run the simulation.  
- Swap the block for a cylinder or sphere and compare.

Highlight:  
- All objects are pulled down by **gravity**.  
- Some shapes roll; others mostly slide.

---

## Part B — Guided Experiments

- As a whole group, test:
  - A cube vs a cylinder vs a sphere.  
  - A shallow ramp vs a steeper ramp.  
- After each trial, pause and ask:
  - Which went furthest?  
  - Did it slide, roll, wobble, or fall off?  
  - What changed when the ramp got steeper?

Keep the focus on **observations**, not formal physics.

---

## Part C — Independent Experiments & Mini Challenges

- Learners build their own ramp setups:
  - Single ramp and ground.  
  - Optional obstacles or gentle curves (if they cope well).  
- Optional challenges:
  - “Which shape reaches the bottom first?”  
  - “Can you design a ramp where the cube wins?”  

Encourage them to run short simulations rather than building overly complex scenes.

---

## Vocabulary for This Week

- **SimLab** — the Tinkercad space that simulates motion, gravity and collisions.  
- **Gravity** — the force pulling objects downwards.  
- **Friction** — the force that slows sliding and rolling where surfaces touch.  
- **Ramp** — a sloping surface.  

---

## Instructor Tips

- Keep early demos **very simple**; complex scenes can confuse younger learners.  
- Use “pause” and “reset” often so everyone can see what happened.  
- Encourage learners to talk about what they see before you name it (e.g. “It slowed down halfway”).  

---

## Assessment & Reflection

Look for:

- Successful loading and running of SimLab scenes.  
- Explanations using words like “roll”, “slide”, “faster” and “slower”.  
- At least one reasoned suggestion for how to change the ramp or shape.

> Prompt: “What did you change in your ramp or object, and what difference did it make?”

## Common Misconceptions & Fixes

| Misconception                         | Clarification / Strategy                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| “The computer is random”             | Emphasise repeatable tests; same setup = same behaviour.   |
| Steeper is always better             | Discuss that too steep may cause tumbling or flying off.   |
| Confusing sliding with rolling       | Pause simulation and zoom in to show how the object moves. |

---

## Differentiation

- **Beginners:**  
  - Work with pre-made ramps and shapes provided by you.  
  - Focus on one variable at a time (shape OR angle).  
- **Confident learners:**  
  - Design multi-stage ramps or obstacle courses.  
  - Compare multiple runs and summarise which design works best.

## Safety & Safeguarding

- Handle earthquake and crash language sensitively if any pupils have difficult experiences.  
- Emphasise that this is a **safe, virtual** environment to try out ideas.
