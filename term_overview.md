# Spring 2026 — Tinkercad Term Overview (Tech Tinker Club)

**Theme:** Design, Make, Iterate  
**Duration:** 10 weeks × 1.5 h  
**Audience:** Mixed-ability Years 4–6 (single group)  

## Intent
- Build confidence using Tinkercad to design purposeful 3D products.  
- Develop spatial reasoning, measurement skills and basic understanding of mechanisms.  
- Introduce simple ideas from parametric design (Codeblocks) and digital circuits.  
- Encourage persistence and iteration — improving designs over time rather than expecting perfection first time.

## Implementation
- Weekly 90-minute sessions across the Spring term.  
- Each week centres on a **mini-project** with a tangible outcome (e.g. tags, stands, spinners, badges).  
- Short whole-group demos followed by guided build time and independent making.  
- Selected designs prepared for printing, while others are celebrated digitally with screenshots and posters.  

## Week-by-Week Summary
1. **Welcome to 3D** — Name tag/keyring; navigation, basic shapes and resizing.  
2. **Align, Group, Holes** — Stamp/cutter; simple Boolean modelling and alignment.  
3. **Measure & Workplanes** — Box & peg; ruler, units and tolerances.  
4. **Mirror & Symmetry** — Creature/rocket; mirrored parts and balance.  
5. **Generators & Scribble** — Badge/pendant; custom forms and parameters.  
6. **Mechanisms** — Spinner or wheel toy; axles, hubs, clearance and friction.  
7. **Print Preparation** — Nameplate/stand; wall thickness, supports and orientation.  
8. **Codeblocks Patterns** — Bracelet/tower; loops, parameters and transforms.  
9. **Circuits** — Blinking LED card (sim); breadboard layout, polarity and simulation.  
10. **Capstone Showcase** — Final print or best-of-term model plus simple presentation.  

## Impact
By the end of the term, most participants will:
- Talk about their designs using correct terms (e.g. workplane, symmetry, tolerance, prototype).  
- Produce at least one model that could be safely printed and used or displayed.  
- Show a clear example of iteration — an updated version that improves on the original.  
- Recognise how Autumn’s Micro:bit work (logic, loops) connects to Spring’s Codeblocks and digital design.
