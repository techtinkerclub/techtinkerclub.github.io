Tech Tinker Club helps children build confidence in **computing, engineering and design** through practical, hands-on projects. Our approach blends coding, electronics, 3D design and scientific thinking in ways that feel meaningful, fun and achievable for mixed ages (Years 4–6).

## Our Approach

### Learning by Making  
Children learn best when they create something real. Every session includes **designing, building, coding, testing and improving** — not just following instructions.

### Mixed-Age, Tiered Activities  
Each project includes:  
- **Level 1:** accessible core build  
- **Level 2:** extensions and customisation  
- **Level 3:** challenge tasks (radio, data, CAD tweaks, analysis)  
This ensures beginners succeed quickly while returning members stay challenged.

### Cross-Curricular Links  
Projects naturally connect to:  
- **Computing:** programming constructs, hardware control, debugging  
- **Science:** electricity, forces, materials, data loggers, fair tests  
- **Design & Technology:** CAD, mechanisms, evaluating and improving products  
- **Maths:** measurement, scale, position, graphs, ratio

## Safety, Inclusion & Responsible Use  
- Step-by-step scaffolded tasks  
- Safe handling of electronics and 3D printing  
- Positive use of technology (privacy, e-safety, teamwork)  
- Adaptations available for all learners (buddy roles, alternative inputs, simplified builds)

## What a Typical Year Looks Like  
Our curriculum follows a clear, repeating structure each year:  

- **Autumn — Micro:bit Foundations**  
  *Physical computing, sensors, motors, data and simple systems.*

- **Spring — Tinkercad Design & Circuits**  
  *3D modelling, mechanisms, SimLab testing and simple circuits.*

- **Summer — Integration & Showcase**  
  *One small product combining code + 3D design + electronics.*
