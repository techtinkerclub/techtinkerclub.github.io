# Tech Tinker Club Curriculum (Years 4–6)

**Intent (Why we do it)**  
Tech Tinker Club exists to spark curiosity and confidence in STEM through **hands-on, real-world projects**. We align to the school’s Computing, Science and D&T curricula while giving pupils extended time to **design, make, code, test and iterate**. Mixed-age sessions (Y4–Y6) are deliberately **tiered** so beginners succeed quickly and returning members are stretched.

**Core Objectives**
- Build **computational thinking** (sequence, selection, repetition, variables, data).  
- Develop **engineering habits** (problem framing, prototyping, testing, evaluation).  
- Practice **Working Scientifically** (fair tests, data logging, observation, conclusions).  
- Strengthen **maths in context** (measurement, units, graphs, ratio/scale).  
- Grow **collaboration & communication** (pair work, peer review, showcases).  
- Cultivate **safe, ethical, and responsible use** of technology.

**Implementation (How it runs)**
- **Term model:**  
  - **Autumn — Micro:bit Foundations** (physical computing, sensors, data, motors).  
  - **Spring — Tinkercad Design & Circuits** (3D design, enclosures, circuit simulation).  
  - **Summer — Integration & Showcase** (combine code + 3D + circuits in one product).  
- **Session structure (≈90 min):** Hook demo → guided build → open extensions → share/reflect.  
- **Tiered tasks:**  
  - *Level 1* (access): core build works for everyone.  
  - *Level 2* (extend): extra feature(s), data/variables, styling.  
  - *Level 3* (challenge): custom ideas, radio networks, CAD tweaks, analysis.  
- **Equipment:** Chromebooks, BBC micro:bits, sensors/motors/servos/expansion boards, 3D printer (used strategically).

**Impact (What success looks like)**
- Pupils can explain **how** their systems work (inputs → processing → outputs).  
- Working prototypes that solve a **clear, user-centred problem**.  
- Evidence of **iteration** (photos, code commits/versions, reflection notes).  
- Improved **vocabulary** across Computing, Science and D&T.  
- Positive dispositions: persistence, debugging mindset, safe/ethical choices online.

**Assessment (light-touch)**
- Quick exit checks (What changed? Why?).  
- Photo/video of outcomes + brief learner reflections.  
- Simple rubrics (Working, Partly, Not yet) for: function, design, explanation, teamwork.

**Inclusion & Safety**
- Accessible entry for all (scaffolded steps, paired programming, checklists).  
- E-safety and tool safety embedded; adult checks for electronics/3D printing.  
- Adaptations available (buddy roles, simplified parts, print-ahead enclosures).

**Alignment (high level)**
- **Computing KS2:** programming constructs; working with hardware; data use.  
- **Science KS2:** Electricity, Light, Forces, Materials; Working Scientifically.  
- **D&T KS2:** Design-Make-Evaluate; mechanical/electrical systems; CAD.  
- **School themes:** club projects reference current term themes to deepen classroom links.
