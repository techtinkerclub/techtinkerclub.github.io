##  Tech Tinker Club Code of Conduct  
*(a.k.a. “How to Be an Awesome Tinkerer”)*

Before you pick up your Micro:bit, wire up that LED, or design your next robot… here’s what makes Tech Tinker Club a brilliant place for everyone:

---

### 1. **Talk it out — but keep it on-topic**  
We love chatting! Especially about circuits, bugs (the computer kind), ideas, and weird science facts.  
But if you're just talking about pizza or Minecraft *again*, we might gently nudge you back to your soldering iron.

---

### 2. **Be kind, curious, and collaborative**  
We work together, help each other out, and cheer on everyone’s projects — even if your robot just did a weird spin and caught fire (again). No put-downs, no eye-rolls. Everyone’s learning here.

---

### 3. **Ask questions. Lots of them.**  
There’s no such thing as a silly question.  
If you’re stuck, ask. If you’re not stuck, help someone who is.  
Curiosity is how all great inventions (and most melted breadboards) begin.

---

### 4. **Try your best — even if it goes boom**  
You don’t have to be a coding genius or circuit wizard.  
All we ask is that you give things a go. Effort counts more than perfection — but sitting around doing nothing doesn’t help you or your team.

---

### 5. **Respect the space, the stuff, and the people**  
We’re lucky to have cool tech to play with — and an even cooler space to use it in.  
So treat everything with care: laptops, wires, tables, chairs, walls, whiteboards… even that slightly wobbly drawer.  
Respect the volunteers who give their time to run the club, your fellow tinkerers, and the school that lets us use the room.  
No throwing, poking, doodling where you shouldn’t, or unplugging things “just to see what happens.”

---

### 6. **This isn’t school. But it’s still for learning.**  
We’re here to build, explore, and have fun — not to muck about or distract others.  
Learning can be messy, noisy, and chaotic — but it still needs focus and fairness.

---

### 7. **No poking wires into places they don’t belong**  
This includes USB ports, your friend’s Micro:bit, your nose, and anything that's not clearly labelled “INPUT.”

---

### 8. **If it’s smoking, sizzling, or glowing strangely — tell us.**  
That could be a brilliant discovery… or a small electrical fire. Better safe than crispy.

---

### 9. **Phones stay in your pocket unless you're using them to code.**  
Or take photos of your amazing creation. Or look up a resistor colour code.  
Just not for TikTok dances. Please. We’re begging you.

---

### 10. **Don’t press buttons unless you know what they do**  
We love curiosity — but don’t press things just to see if they explode.  
That includes laptops, wires, power switches, and especially that mysterious button labelled “DO NOT PRESS.”  
(Seriously. Don’t.)

---

### In summary:  
**Be curious. Be kind. Be involved. Be sensible-ish.**  
And most importantly — **be ready to tinker.**
