# Curriculum 2025–26 — Overview (Y4–Y6)

**Intent**  
A coherent, year-long journey where pupils **learn by making**: Autumn builds coding + electronics fluency; Spring builds design + circuit simulation; Summer fuses both into a polished product with a public showcase.

## Term at a glance

| Term | Focus | Example Outcomes | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Autumn** | **Micro:bit Foundations** (physical computing) | Reaction timer; sensor alarm; servo pointer; mini data-logger | Inputs/outputs, events, loops, variables, thresholds, data logging, motors/servos, basic radio |
| **Spring** | **Tinkercad Design & Circuits** | Personalised key tag; gadget enclosure; simulated night-light/traffic light | 3D primitives, group/align, tolerances, nets/enclosures, breadboard basics, components, series vs parallel |
| **Summer** | **Integration & Showcase** | Working prototype in printed case (e.g., smart plant/pet monitor, flood alarm, wearable) | System design (I→P→O), user needs, assembly, testing, evaluation, presentation |

## Objectives for 2025–26
- Pupils will **write, test and debug** programs that use **sequence, selection, repetition and variables** to control hardware.  
- Pupils will **measure and log data**, then **interpret and communicate** findings (tables/graphs/verbal).  
- Pupils will **design in 3D** with attention to **fit, tolerance and safety**, producing printable enclosures.  
- Pupils will complete at least **one integrated product** that solves a **real need** and present it to others.

## Progression & differentiation (mixed Years 4–6)
- **Beginners:** block coding, single-sensor builds, off-the-shelf enclosures or paper prototypes.  
- **Returners:** multi-sensor systems, radio networking, custom CAD, basic Python (optional).  
- **Leadership:** experienced pupils mentor peers (code reviews, wiring checks, demo duty).

## Assessment & evidence (light-touch)
- **Make + explain**: short demo plus “How does it work?” diagram (inputs → process → outputs).  
- Photo/video gallery; code files; one-page project sheet (problem, design, test, next steps).

### Safeguarding, E-safety & Risk
- Adult checks on power, sharp tools, hot parts (3D printer).  
- No personal data in code/files; photo consent followed; online conduct reinforced.

### Equipment & platforms
Chromebooks · BBC micro:bit (MakeCode; optional Python) · motors/servos/expansion boards · Tinkercad (3D & Circuits) · 3D printer (selective, pre-sliced).
