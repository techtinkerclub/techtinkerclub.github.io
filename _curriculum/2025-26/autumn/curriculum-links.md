# KS2 Curriculum Links — Autumn 2025 Micro:bit Term

## KS2 Computing

- **Programming A — Sequence in Programs**  
  Pupils build simple micro:bit programs that respond to button presses, show LED patterns and run through a clear sequence of instructions (Weeks 1–2 and early games).

- **Programming B — Repetition in Programs**  
  Loops are used to animate LED sprites, repeat sounds and update scores in games such as *Barrel Jumper* and later score-based button games (Weeks 5, 6, 11).

- **Programming C — Variables in Programs**  
  Variables track scores, lives, timers, or sensor readings such as light level and temperature in monitoring projects and games (Weeks 3–6, 10–12).

- **Programming D — Selection in Programs**  
  `if` / `else` logic is used to react to conditions (e.g. “if A wins…”, “if light level < threshold…”, “if motion AND dark…”), particularly in Rock–Paper–Scissors, alarms and two-sensor gadgets (Weeks 3, 4, 10–12).

- **Computing Systems & Networks (Micro:bit Radio)**  
  Radio activities (quiz buzzers, *Fireflies* and *Exploding Duck*) introduce the idea of devices sharing data on a group/channel and using IDs or timing rules for fair communication (Weeks 8–9).

- **Creating Media (Sound & Display)**  
  Pupils design LED icons, animations and simple tunes, linking patterns, pitch and tempo to how devices give feedback in the real world (throughout the term, especially game weeks).

- **Logical Reasoning & Debugging**  
  Pupils predict what programs will do, test them, explain unexpected behaviour and fix bugs step by step, using reasoning like “if this condition is never true, the code inside will never run”.

## KS2 Design & Technology

- **Design**  
  Pupils design simple interactive artefacts (e.g. dice rollers, reaction games, alarms, two-sensor gadgets) with a clear purpose and user in mind (classmates, Cubs, family).

- **Make**  
  They assemble digital “systems” using inputs (buttons, shake, light, motion), processes (code with variables and logic) and outputs (LEDs, sound, radio messages). Some weeks also involve sketching ideas or planning their system before coding (Weeks 10–12).

- **Evaluate**  
  Pupils test their programs, identify bugs, compare different solutions (e.g. different control schemes or scoring rules), and suggest improvements. In later weeks they reflect on how well their gadget meets the brief.

- **Technical Knowledge**  
  They begin to understand that many modern products use microcontrollers, sensors and communication (radio/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) to respond to the environment — linking the micro:bit to real products like alarms, remote controls and games controllers.

## KS2 Maths

- **Number & Counting**  
  Variables and loops support counting scores, attempts and lives. Some activities involve comparing totals or resetting values.

- **Measurement & Time**  
  Use of pauses in milliseconds, timings between events, and reaction-speed ideas link programming to elapsed time and simple timing challenges.

- **Statistics & Comparison**  
  Simple comparisons such as highest score, fastest reaction, “who buzzed first?” and win/draw/lose outcomes build informal data-handling and comparison skills.

- **Probability & Reasoning**  
  Projects like dice rollers and Rock–Paper–Scissors invite discussion of randomness, fairness and likelihood, even without formal notation.

- **Logical Thinking**  
  Pupils practice “if this, then that” reasoning when designing and debugging conditions and game rules.

## Science & Engineering Links

- **Electricity & Components (conceptual)**  
  The micro:bit is used as an example of a small electronic system with power, inputs, processing and outputs. Where used, external components (motors, buzzers, servos) reinforce this idea.

- **Forces & Motion**  
  Movement-based inputs (accelerometer, shake, tilt) connect digital logic to physical motion in games and alarms.

- **Sound & Waves (Radio & Audio weeks)**  
  Sessions on sound and radio waves link pitch, amplitude and frequency to how devices communicate and how we hear sound, especially in radio games and alarm projects.

- **Sensing the Environment**  
  Light, temperature and motion sensing in monitoring projects and the “dark + motion” alarm link computing to real-world sensing and safety systems (Weeks 4, 10–12).

## PSHE / Teamwork & Communication

- **Collaboration**  
  Pair- and group-based coding encourages turn-taking, shared debugging and explaining ideas to others. Multiplayer and radio activities rely on cooperation and clear communication.

- **Fairness & Rules**  
  Quiz buzzers, firefly-style synchronisation games and competitive mini-games require clear rules about who wins, what counts as a valid press, and how ties or false starts are handled.

- **Resilience & Growth Mindset**  
  Debugging is presented as normal and positive — mistakes and bugs are part of learning. Pupils are encouraged to keep trying, test changes and celebrate improvements rather than perfection.

## Summary

Across the Autumn term, pupils move from simple button-press programs to small interactive games, radio projects and two-sensor gadgets. They practise **core programming ideas** (sequence, repetition, variables, selection), understand **inputs → process → outputs**, and see clear links between their code and **real products** such as alarms, controllers and communication systems.
