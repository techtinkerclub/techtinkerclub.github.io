## Week 5 — Loops & Our First Game

**Focus Concept:** Loops & Iteration  
**Mini-Project:** *Barrel Jumper* (sprites, movement, collisions)

---

## Objectives
- Understand how **loops** repeat instructions automatically.
- Compare loop types: **repeat**, **for**, **while**, and **forever**.
- Use **timing** (pauses / `millis`) to control speed in loops.
- Build a simple **game** with sprites that move and interact.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **loop** and an **iteration** are.
- I can choose the right loop for a task (fixed repeats, ranges, or until a condition).
- I can use **timing** to make animations/gameplay smoother or harder.
- I can make a game where sprites move, **collide**, and update a **score**.

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Loop** — instructions that repeat automatically.  
  - **repeat / for**: run a fixed number of times or across a range.  
  - **while**: keep running while a condition is true.  
  - **forever**: never stops (the “game loop”).
- **Iteration** — one pass through a loop.
- **Timer / `millis`** — the micro:bit’s clock in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 s); useful for timing within loops.
- **Variable** — a named box that stores changing values (e.g., `score`, `speed`, `x`, `y`).
- **Sprite** — a sprite is a two-dimensional graphic object or image that can move freely in a digital environment. Sprites typically consist of pixel images and are used to represent characters, objects, backgrounds, and visual effects in video games and other interactive applications.
- **Collision detection** — checking if two sprites touch.
- **Game loop** — a loop that continually updates movement, checks collisions, and redraws.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables  
- Chromebooks with internet access  
- Optional: headphones/speaker for sound effects

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Keep USB leads tidy and handle gently.
- If adding sound effects, keep volume classroom-friendly.
