## Week 3 — Conditionals (if/else)

**Focus Concept:** Logic & Decision-Making  
**Mini-Project:** Rock–Paper–Scissors  

---

## Objectives
- Understand how **conditionals (if/else)** allow programs to make decisions.  
- Explore how **random numbers** can be used to simulate choices.  
- Create a Rock–Paper–Scissors game using the micro:bit.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **conditional** is.  
- I can build a program that uses **if/else** to make the micro:bit display different outputs.  
- I can play Rock–Paper–Scissors against my friends using micro:bits.  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Conditional (if/else):** a rule that checks something and decides what to do.  
- **Logic:** the reasoning we use to make decisions in code (e.g. if this happens, then do that).  
- **Random:** an unpredictable number chosen by the computer.  
- **Fairness:** in probability, each option should have the same chance of being chosen.  
- **Event:** something that triggers code (button press, shake).

- **Starter: Simple Coin Flipper (recap PRIMM):** [link](https://makecode.microbit.org/S48819-26737-74641-22192){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  
- **Rock–Paper–Scissors Project Guide:** [link](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors-v2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  

---

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (1 per child or pair).  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Optional: paper/markers to track scores.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Take care when shaking the micro:bits.  
- Remind pupils not to drop devices during the game.

## Activity Steps

**1. Warm-Up — PRIMM Example (Heads/Tails)**  
- Open the [coin flipper project](https://makecode.microbit.org/S39804-79642-83776-27829).  
- Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify.  
- Discuss how the program uses **random numbers** and **conditionals**.  

**2. Introducing Conditionals**  
- Show how `if … else` can be used in MakeCode.  
- Example:  
  - If button A pressed → show 😀  
  - Else → show 😢  

**3. Rock–Paper–Scissors Build**  
- Shake event → generate random number (1–3).  
- If 1 → show ✊ (rock)  
- Else if 2 → show ✋ (paper)  
- Else → show ✌️ (scissors).  
- Pupils play against each other using their micro:bits.  

**4. Extensions**  
- Add a “best of 3” scoring system.  
- Use sound effects or animations for each choice.  
- Create a scoreboard using variables.  

**5. Reflect & Share**  
- Discuss: *“Is this game fair?”*  
- Connect to science/maths: chance, probability, fairness.
