## Week 2 — Events & Inputs

**Focus Concept:** Inputs & Events  
**Mini-Project:** Dice Roller  

---

## Objectives
- Understand that **events** (like button presses or shakes) can trigger different actions.  
- Explore how the micro:bit can generate **random numbers** to simulate dice.  
- Write and test a program that responds to **button presses** and **shake events**.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what an **event** is in computing.  
- I can use the **`on button pressed`** or **`on shake`** block to trigger code.  
- I can build a dice roller using `pick random` and display the result.  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Event** — something that happens (like pressing a button or shaking the device) that the program can respond to.  
- **Input** — information from the outside world, e.g. button presses or movement.  
- **Output** — what the micro:bit does in response (e.g. lights, sound, text).  
- **Random** — an unpredictable choice made by the computer.  
- **Conditional** — an instruction that checks something and chooses between outcomes (introduced lightly here).

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (1 per child or pair).  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Optional: real dice for comparison activity.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Remind pupils to plug/unplug micro:bits gently.  
- Demonstrate correct handling of devices during shake events.

## Activity Steps

**1. Explore Events**  
- Test simple `on button A pressed` → show icon.  
- Discuss: *“What is the input? What is the output?”*  

**2. PRIMM Starter: Coin Toss**  
- Use the [Simple Coin Flipper](https://makecode.microbit.org/S39804-79642-83776-27829){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  
- Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify (change icons, text, sounds).  

**3. Build the Dice Roller**  
- New project: `on shake` → `set roll = pick random 1 to 6`.  
- Use `if … else if … else` blocks to display number icons.  

**4. Extension Ideas**  
- Add sound effects for each number.  
- Display text (“You rolled a 6!”).  
- Create two dice and add them together.  

**5. Reflect & Share**  
- Pupils demonstrate their dice rollers.  
- Discussion: *“Is the dice roller fair?”*
