## Week 3 — Conditionals: If / Else Decisions  

**Focus Concept:** Conditionals (if / else) & Logic  
**Mini-Project:** Rock–Paper–Scissors Game  

---

## Objectives
- Understand that computers can make **decisions** based on conditions.  
- Use the `if / else` block to control program flow.  
- Explore randomness and fairness in computing.  
- Build a Rock–Paper–Scissors game using conditionals and variables.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **conditional** is (if something is true, then do this; otherwise, do that).  
- I can predict and test the outcome of a program using `if / else`.  
- I can make my micro:bit play Rock–Paper–Scissors with random choices.  

---

## Key Vocabulary & Definitions
- **Conditional** — code that makes a decision (e.g., *if…then…else*).  
- **Logic** — rules used in decision-making (AND, OR, NOT).  
- **Variable** — a named value that can change while the program runs (e.g., score).  
- **Random** — an unpredictable number the computer chooses.  
- **Fairness** — the idea that each outcome should have an equal chance of happening (probability).

## Resources
- **Starter activity (Heads/Tails):** [MakeCode Starter Project](#)  
- **Main project (RPS):** [Rock–Paper–Scissors V2 Project](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors-v2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  
- **MakeCode editor:** [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  
- **Optional Science link:** Probability and fairness in games.  

---

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables.  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Optional: printed “decision grid” for Rock–Paper–Scissors.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Safe handling of cables as before.  
- Remind pupils to work in pairs for debugging and testing fairness.

## Lesson Flow (≈90 min)

**1) Starter — Heads/Tails PRIMM (15 min)**  
- Predict what will happen with the coin toss code (`pick random 0–1`).  
- Run the program on simulator & device.  
- Investigate: change range, remove `else`, test fairness.  
- Modify: add icons, sounds, score variable.  
- Discuss: “Is it fair? What does random mean?”  

**2) Teach / Model — Rock–Paper–Scissors (10 min)**  
- Show decision grid (Player vs Computer outcomes).  
- Introduce nested `if / else if / else`.  
- Highlight that this is a **3-way decision** compared to the 2-way coin toss.  

**3) Guided Build (30 min)**  
- Shake = random computer choice.  
- Player chooses via buttons (A=Rock, B=Paper, A+B=Scissors).  
- Use `if / else` blocks to decide win/lose/draw.  
- Add a `score` variable.  

**4) Extensions & Challenges (20 min)**  
- Add sounds or icons for outcomes.  
- Add “best of 3” scoring system.  
- Stretch: use **radio** for 2-player game.  

**5) Share & Reflect (15 min)**  
- Pupils show games to each other.  
- Class discussion: “How does the micro:bit decide?”  
- Tease Week 4: Variables in more depth.
