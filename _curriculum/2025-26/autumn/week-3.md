## Week 3 — Conditionals: If / Else Decisions  

**Focus Concept:** Conditionals (if / else) & Logic  
**Mini-Project:** Rock–Paper–Scissors  

---

## Objectives
- Understand that computers can make **decisions** using `if / else`.  
- Use conditionals to create a 2-way (coin toss) and 3-way (RPS) program.  
- Link randomness and fairness to **probability in Maths** and **chance in Science**.  
- Build a Rock–Paper–Scissors program where the micro:bit chooses randomly.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **conditional** is.  
- I can write a program with `if / else if / else`.  
- I can make the micro:bit display Rock, Paper, or Scissors at random.  

---

## Key Vocabulary & Definitions
- **Conditional** — code that makes a decision (if…then…else).  
- **Logic** — rules used in decisions (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).  
- **Random** — an unpredictable number chosen by the computer.  
- **Fairness** — when each outcome has the same chance.  
- **Variable** — a named value that can change during a program.

- **MakeCode Editor:** [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables.  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Optional: printed Rock–Paper–Scissors decision grid.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Usual safe handling of devices and cables.  
- Remind pupils to play fairly and take turns shaking the micro:bit.

## Lesson Flow (≈90 minutes)

**1) Starter — Coin Toss PRIMM (15 min)**  
- Pupils predict, run, investigate, and modify a simple coin flip program.  
- Link to fairness and probability (50/50 chance).  

**2) Teach / Model — Rock–Paper–Scissors (10 min)**  
- Show how 3-way decisions need `if / else if / else`.  
- Compare with coin toss (2-way).  

**3) Guided Build (30 min)**  
- Shake = random choice 0–2.  
- If 0 → Rock, if 1 → Paper, else → Scissors.  
- Display LED icons or patterns.  

**4) Extensions & Challenges (20 min)**  
- Add score variable (track player vs micro:bit).  
- Add sound effects or animations.  
- Challenge: display “Win/Lose/Draw” if pupils press a button to enter their own move.  

**5) Share & Reflect (15 min)**  
- Pupils play RPS against the micro:bit (hands vs LEDs).  
- Reflect: “Why is the game fair?” “How did the micro:bit decide?”  
- Tease Week 4: variables in more depth.
