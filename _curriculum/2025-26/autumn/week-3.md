# Week 4 — Variables & Thresholds: Smart Plant Protector

## Overview
Today we build a tiny “greenhouse helper” with a micro:bit. It reads **temperature** and **light**, stores them in **variables**, compares them with **thresholds**, and shows whether a plant is **happy**, **too cold**, **too hot**, or **too dark**.

---

## Learning goals
- Use **variables** to store live sensor readings (temperature, light).
- Apply **thresholds** with `if…then…else` logic.
- Combine **two inputs** to make a single decision (light AND temperature).
- Test, tune, and **justify** chosen thresholds from observations.

---

## Prerequisites (from Week 2–3)
- Basic MakeCode navigation & downloading to a micro:bit.
- Reading a single sensor and using simple **logic** (if/else).
- Optional: simple icons/strings on the LED display.

---

## Key vocabulary (consistent with Week 2–3)
- **Logic** — the set of rules a computer follows to decide what to do. In coding we use conditionals (logic blocks like `if…then…else`) to check conditions and choose between actions. Logic can also use connectors such as **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** to combine conditions.  
- **Variable**
