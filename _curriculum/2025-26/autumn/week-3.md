## Week 3 — Conditionals (if/else)

**Focus Concept:** Logic & Decision-Making  
**Mini-Project:** Rock–Paper–Scissors  

---

## Objectives
- Understand how **conditionals (if/else)** allow programs to make decisions.  
- Use `if … else` to create different outcomes in code.  
- Build a Rock–Paper–Scissors program where the micro:bit chooses at random.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **conditional** is.  
- I can build a program that uses **if/else** to show different outputs based on a **random** choice.  
- I can play Rock–Paper–Scissors fairly using my micro:bit.

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Input** — information the micro:bit receives (e.g. button presses, motion).  
- **Output** — what the micro:bit does in response (LEDs, sound, text).  
- **Event** — something that happens (like pressing a button or shaking the device) that starts code.  
- **Conditional (if/else)** — a rule in code that checks something and chooses what to do.  
- **Logic** — the set of rules a computer follows to decide what to do. In coding we use conditionals (logic blocks like **if…then…else**) to check conditions and choose between actions. Logic can also use connectors such as **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** to combine conditions.  
- **Variable** — a named “box” in memory that stores information your program can use or change (e.g. storing a dice roll or a random choice).  
- **Random** — an unpredictable number chosen by the computer.  
- **Fairness** — when all outcomes have the same chance (important in games of chance).

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (1 per child or pair)  
- Chromebooks with internet access

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Handle devices gently when using shake or button events.  
- Share devices and take turns fairly.
