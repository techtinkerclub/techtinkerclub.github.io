## Week 6 — Functions & Smarter Barrel Jumper

**Focus Concept:** Functions (without parameters)  
**Mini-Project:** Barrel Jumper 2.0 — Smarter Code with Functions  

---

## Objectives
- Review how **loops** keep a game running.  
- Learn what a **function** is and how it helps avoid repeating code.  
- Use functions to tidy the **jump** and **level-up** parts of the game.  
- Add simple improvements such as sound and level display.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **function** is and why it’s useful.  
- I can create and call a function in MakeCode.  
- I can make the game run correctly using loops, variables, and functions.  
- I can debug and improve my program independently.

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Function** — a named group of instructions that can be reused.  
- **Call** — when you make the program run a function.  
- **Variable** — a “box” that stores a number or piece of information.  
- **Loop** — instructions that repeat automatically.  
- **Condition** — checks if something is true before running code.  
- **Iteration** — one full run through a loop.  
- **Debugging** — finding and fixing errors in your code.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables  
- Chromebooks with internet access  
- Optional: speakers or headphones for sound effects  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Keep USB cables tidy and avoid pulling on connected micro:bits.  
- Make sure pupils only have one MakeCode project open at a time.  
- Remind everyone to test small changes often to avoid big errors.
