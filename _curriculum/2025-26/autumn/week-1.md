## Week 1 — Welcome & Micro:bit Basics

**Focus Concept:** Events & Sequencing  
**Mini-Project:** Digital Name Badge

---

## Objectives
- Get to know the club and how we work together.  
- Understand what a **microcontroller** is and what the **BBC micro:bit** can do.  
- Explore **MakeCode** (logging in, creating, simulating, downloading, uploading).  
- Write and test a first program (scrolling name badge).

---

## Success Criteria 
- I can explain what a microcontroller does (input → process → output).  
- I can open MakeCode, create a project, and send it to my micro:bit.  
- I can make my micro:bit display my name and react to button presses.
