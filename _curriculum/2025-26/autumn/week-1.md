## Week 1 — Welcome & Micro:bit Basics

**Focus Concept:** Events & Sequencing  
**Mini-Project:** Digital Name Badge

---

## Objectives
- Get to know the club and how we work together.  
- Understand what a **microcontroller** is and what the **BBC micro:bit** can do.  
- Explore **MakeCode** (logging in, creating, simulating, downloading, uploading).  
- Write and test a first program (scrolling name, button icons).

---

## Success Criteria (pupil-friendly)
- I can explain what a microcontroller does (input → process → output).  
- I can open MakeCode, create a project, and send it to my micro:bit.  
- I can make my micro:bit display my name and react to button presses.  

---

## Key Vocabulary
_microcontroller_, _input_, _output_, _event_, _sequence_, _program_, _debug_

---

## Resources
- **Slides:** [Week 1 Slides](#)  
- **Worksheet:** [Week 1 Worksheet](#)  
- **Starter code / MakeCode project:** [link to template](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)  
- **Teacher reference (private):** [link to notes](#)

---

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (1 per child or pair).  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Optional: name badge template sheet for designing an “off-screen” badge too.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Remind pupils not to pull cables too hard.  
- Show correct way to disconnect the micro:bit from USB.  
- Encourage sharing equipment and helping partners.

## Lesson Plan (≈90 minutes)

**1) Welcome & Icebreaker (10 min)**  
- Say hello, explain the club ethos (*“We make things that think!”*).  
- Quick icebreaker: “What’s the coolest gadget you use every day?”  

**2) Club Rules & How We Work (10 min)**  
- Respect equipment and each other.  
- Mistakes = part of learning.  
- We collaborate — sometimes coding solo, sometimes in pairs.

**3) What is a Microcontroller? (10 min)**  
- Show a micro:bit: “This tiny board is a computer!”  
- Input → Process → Output chain with simple demo (press A → show smiley).  
- Relate to real world: remote controls, washing machines, cars.  

**4) MakeCode Tour (15 min)**  
- Open [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org).  
- Show simulator, block palette, “Download” button.  
- Everyone logs in/creates their first project.

**5) First Program — Digital Name Badge (25 min)**  
- Task: scroll their name across the LEDs.  
- Add button events: A = smiley, B = heart.  
- Extension: make A+B show a custom pattern.  
- Super-challenge: dice roller using `pick random 1–6`.

**6) Reflection & Wrap-Up (15 min)**  
- Share: *“Show your badge to your neighbour.”*  
- Quick Q&A: “What’s an input? What’s an output?”  
- Tease next week: *“We’ll use the micro:bit as a dice roller!”*

---

## Assessment
- Can pupils describe input → process → output?  
- Did they succeed in uploading a program?  
- Can they debug (fix) when the program doesn’t work at first?

---

## Differentiation
- **New coders:** scaffolded blocks, copy the demo.  
- **Experienced coders:** add random dice roller or scrolling animations.  

---

## Troubleshooting
- If micro:bit doesn’t flash: check cable → use another port → restart MakeCode.  
- If name doesn’t scroll: confirm blocks are in the `on start` block, not empty workspace.
