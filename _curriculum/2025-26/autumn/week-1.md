## Week 1 — Welcome & Micro:bit Basics

**Focus Concept:** Events & Sequencing  
**Mini-Project:** Digital Name Badge

---

## Objectives
- Get to know the club and how we work together.  
- Understand what a **microcontroller** is and what the **BBC micro:bit** can do.  
- Explore **MakeCode** (logging in, creating, simulating, downloading, uploading).  
- Write and test a first program (scrolling name badge).

---

## Success Criteria 
- I can explain what a microcontroller does (input → process → output).  
- I can open MakeCode, create a project, and send it to my micro:bit.  
- I can make my micro:bit display my name and react to button presses.

## Key Vocabulary & Definitions
- **Microcontroller** — a tiny computer on a single chip that controls devices.  
- **Input** — something the micro:bit senses (e.g., button press, light, shake).  
- **Output** — what the micro:bit does in response (e.g., show LEDs, play sound).  
- **Event** — something that happens and triggers code (e.g., “on start”, “on button A pressed”).  
- **Sequence** — a set of steps the computer follows in order.  
- **Algorithm** — a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or complete a task.  
- **Program** — an algorithm that has been written in a way a computer or micro:bit can follow.  
- **Programming Language** — the special way we write instructions so computers understand them. MakeCode uses **blocks**, but it’s also a programming language.  
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** — the software we use to write and test programs. For micro:bit we use **MakeCode IDE** in the web browser.  
- **Simulator** — a tool inside MakeCode that lets you test your program on a “virtual micro:bit” before sending it to the real one.  
- **Debug** — finding and fixing mistakes in a program.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (1 per child or pair).  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  
- Optional: printed badge design template sheet.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Remind pupils not to pull cables too hard.  
- Show correct way to disconnect the micro:bit from USB.  
- Encourage sharing equipment and helping partners.
