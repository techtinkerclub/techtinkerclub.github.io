## Week 4 — Variables & Thresholds with Sensors

**Focus Concept:** Variables & Thresholds  
**Mini-Project:** Smart Plant Monitor (light + temperature sensors)

---

## Objectives
- Understand what a **variable** is in coding.  
- Learn what a **threshold** means and how it controls decisions.  
- Explore how the **light** and **temperature** sensors on the micro:bit work.  
- Create a simple monitor that warns when it’s too dark or too cold.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a variable is and why it’s useful.  
- I can use a variable to store a sensor value.  
- I can compare sensor values with a threshold.  
- I can make the micro:bit give a warning when the threshold is crossed.

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Variable** — a “box” in memory that stores a value which can change.  
- **Threshold** — a limit or boundary we compare against (e.g. “if temp < 15°C”).  
- **Sensor** — a device that measures something from the environment, like light or temperature.  
- **Input** — information coming into the micro:bit (e.g. from a sensor).  
- **Output** — how the micro:bit reacts (e.g. LEDs, sound, message).  
- **Logic** — rules that decide what happens (e.g. if…then…else).  
- **Loop** — instructions that repeat automatically. A loop can run forever or stop when a condition is met.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables.  
- Chromebooks with internet access.  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Sensors are built-in, no extra hardware needed.  
- Avoid touching USB ends with damp hands (remind pupils as “plant monitor” is discussed).
