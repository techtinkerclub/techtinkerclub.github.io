## Week 9 — Fireflies & Exploding Ducks

**Focus Concept:** Radio synchronisation and local communication  
**Mini-Project:** *Exploding Ducks* (multiplayer radio game)

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> We explored how <strong>radio messages</strong> let devices share information wirelessly and react to events.</li>
    <li><strong>Science:</strong> We connected this to how <strong>fireflies</strong> synchronise in nature—simple local rules leading to complex group behaviour.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> We used <strong>timers</strong>, <strong>random numbers</strong>, and <strong>conditional logic</strong> to control outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering &amp; Technology:</strong> We designed and tested a small <strong>networked system</strong> that communicates reliably in real time.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This week linked biology, science and computing.  
We began by observing how **fireflies communicate using light** and how they manage to flash in rhythm without a leader.  
Then we applied the same idea with the **micro:bit radio**, finishing with a lively multiplayer game called *Exploding Ducks!* 🦆💥

---

## Objectives
- Understand how **local communication** can lead to **synchronised patterns**.  
- Use the **micro:bit radio** to send and receive messages.  
- Practise **variables**, **random values**, **events** and **conditions**.  
- Build and test a multiplayer game that reacts in real time.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can describe how fireflies synchronise using simple local rules.  
- I can explain how a shared **radio group** allows devices to communicate.  
- I can use a **timer** to trigger an action when it reaches zero.  
- I can test and debug a multiplayer radio program.

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Synchronisation** — matching timing or rhythm with others.  
- **Local rule** — a simple instruction each device follows on its own.  
- **Radio message** — data sent wirelessly between devices.  
- **Event** — something that happens and triggers code to run.  
- **Variable** — a stored value that can change.  
- **Random** — producing unpredictable outcomes in code.  
- **Condition** — a true/false test that controls decisions.

---

## Part A — Fireflies and Synchronisation
We started with a short discussion and demonstration:

- Watched the interactive **Fireflies simulator** to see how individual rules create group patterns.  
- Explored the **MakeCode Fireflies** project and predicted what would happen as timing or brightness changed.  
- Linked this to how computers and sensors coordinate without a central leader.

> 💡 Key idea: each “firefly” follows a small local rule, but together they create a shared rhythm.

## Part B — From Fireflies to Radio
We connected the biology idea to computing by using **micro:bit radio**.  
Participants discussed how devices “talk” over a shared group, and how events and variables control behaviour and timing.

---

## Part C — Exploding Ducks (Build & Play)
We built a simple multiplayer game where one player holds an invisible “duck” with a hidden timer.  
Players can **shake** to pass it on; if the timer ends, the duck “explodes” and that player is out.  
We tested in small circles, then as a whole group.

> 🧠 This reinforced events (shake/receive), variables (ID, timer), and fairness in radio communication.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (or simulator)  
- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet access  
- Batteries (for untethered play)  
- Space to stand in a circle for testing

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Use a shared **radio group** for this session only to avoid interference.  
- Ensure clear floor space when playing the multiplayer game.  
- Keep cables tidy during programming time.
