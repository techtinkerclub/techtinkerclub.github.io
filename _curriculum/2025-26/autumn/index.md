# Autumn 2025 — Micro:bit Foundations

**Theme:** *“From inputs to outputs: making systems that sense and respond.”*

This term, pupils in Tech Tinker Club will explore how microcontrollers (tiny computers that power gadgets, robots and everyday devices) can be programmed to **sense the world and control outputs**. Using the BBC micro:bit, motors, buzzers, servos and built-in sensors, children will design fun mini-projects that blend **computing concepts** with real-world making.

---

## Intent (What we want to achieve)
- Build understanding of the **Input → Process → Output** model.  
- Introduce and practise key computing concepts: events, variables, loops, conditionals, logic, data and communication.  
- Show how **science and computing connect** (sensors, electricity, data logging).  
- Develop **confidence and creativity** through small projects that children can explain and adapt.

---

## Implementation (How we will do it)
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions**, every Wednesday from 10 Sept – 17 Dec (13 sessions).  
- Each week introduces a **new computing idea** inside a **fun project**.  
- Projects are designed with **tiers of challenge** so every child can access and extend.

## Week by Week Overview

| Week | Date | Focus Concept | Mini-Project Example |
|------|------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 10 Sept | Intro to club & microcontrollers | Name badge, button icons |
| 2 | 17 Sept | Events & inputs | Dice roller (shake to roll) |
| 3 | 24 Sept | Conditionals (if/else) | Reaction timer game |
| 4 | 1 Oct | Variables & thresholds | Light/temperature monitor |
| 5 | 8 Oct | Loops (iteration) | Step counter |
| 6 | 15 Oct | Outputs (servo & buzzer) | Servo dial + alarm |
| **Half Term** | 29 Oct | ❌ No session | – |
| 7 | 5 Nov | Mini-project consolidation | Burglar alarm or tilt gadget |
| 8 | 12 Nov | Data logging | Temperature tracker |
| 9 | 19 Nov | Radio communication | Wireless message sender |
| 10 | 26 Nov | Compound logic | Dark + motion alarm |
| 11 | 3 Dec | Game loops | Score-based button game |
| 12 | 10 Dec | Integration | Design your own 2-sensor gadget |
| 13 | 17 Dec | Showcase & reflection | Share favourite projects |

## Impact (What success looks like)
- Pupils can describe their creations in terms of **inputs, processing and outputs**.  
- They use **computing vocabulary** (variables, loops, conditions).  
- They demonstrate **debugging strategies** and persistence.  
- By the end of term, every child has completed a set of working mini-projects and shared one with peers.

## Looking ahead
- **Spring 2026:** Tinkercad Design & Circuits — designing and simulating enclosures and circuits.  
- **Summer 2026:** Integration & Showcase — combining micro:bit coding with 3D design and circuits.
