# Autumn 2025 — Micro:bit Foundations

**Theme:** *“From inputs to outputs: making systems that sense and respond.”*

This term, participants in Tech Tinker Club will explore how microcontrollers (tiny computers that power gadgets, robots and everyday devices) can be programmed to **sense the world and control outputs**. Using the BBC micro:bit, motors, buzzers, servos and built-in sensors, children will design fun mini-projects that blend **computing concepts** with real-world making.

---

## Intent (What we want to achieve)
- Build understanding of the **Input → Process → Output** model.  
- Introduce and practise key computing concepts: events, variables, loops, conditionals, logic, data and communication.  
- Show how **science and computing connect** (sensors, electricity, data logging).  
- Develop **confidence and creativity** through small projects that children can explain and adapt.

---

## Implementation (How we will do it)
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** throughout the Autumn term.  
- Each week introduces a **new computing idea** inside a **fun project**.  
- Projects are designed with **tiers of challenge** so every child can access and extend.  
- ⚠️ **Please note:** This is our planned sequence, but plans are made to be flexible — we may adapt activities depending on time, resources, or the group’s interests.

## Impact (What success looks like)
- Participants can describe their creations in terms of **inputs, processing and outputs**.  
- They use **computing vocabulary** (variables, loops, conditions).  
- They demonstrate **debugging strategies** and persistence.  
- By the end of term, every child has completed a set of working mini-projects and shared one with peers.

## Looking ahead
- **Spring 2026:** Tinkercad Design & Circuits — designing and simulating enclosures and circuits.  
- **Summer 2026:** Integration — combining micro:bit coding with 3D design and circuits.
