## Week 8 — Radio Waves & Pass the Ghost

**Focus Concept:** Radio communication and wave basics  
**Mini-Project:** *Pass the Ghost* (multiplayer radio)

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> We will exchange data using the <strong>micro:bit radio</strong> and explore how groups and channels work.</li>
    <li><strong>Science:</strong> We will link our project to how <strong>signals</strong> and communication happen in everyday devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> We will consider <strong>timing</strong>, ordering, and <strong>ranking</strong>—for example, who buzzes first.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering &amp; Technology:</strong> We will design a fair communication system with clear <strong>feedback</strong> and reliable resets.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


This week’s session mixed **science and coding**.  
We began by exploring **waves** — how they move energy and information — and linked that to how the **micro:bit radio** works.  
Participants then built a small program called *Pass the Ghost*, where one micro:bit sends a message to another, showing a ghost icon and short sound when received.

---

## Objectives
- Understand what a **wave** is and how **radio waves** carry information.  
- Learn the ideas of **amplitude**, **frequency**, and **wavelength** in simple terms.  
- Identify common uses of radio waves (music, phones, Wi-Fi, etc.).  
- Use **micro:bit radio** to send and receive a message.  
- Add sound effects and experiment with inputs and outputs.  
- Revisit concepts from Weeks 1–2 through a short quiz.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain that waves transfer energy, not matter.  
- I can describe radio waves as a type of electromagnetic wave.  
- I can say what **frequency** and **amplitude** mean.  
- I can use the micro:bit to send a simple message by radio.  
- I can debug and improve a program that uses radio blocks.

## Key Vocabulary
- **Wave** — a moving pattern that transfers energy.  
- **Amplitude** — how tall a wave is (strength).  
- **Frequency** — how many waves per second (pitch for sound).  
- **Wavelength** — distance from one wave peak to the next.  
- **Radio wave** — an electromagnetic wave used for communication.  
- **Transmitter** — device that sends the signal.  
- **Receiver** — device that picks it up.  
- **Radio Group** — a shared channel that devices join to talk.  
- **ID** — a number that identifies each micro:bit.  
- **Amplitude (modulation)** and **frequency (modulation)** — ways to carry sound on radio waves.  

---

## Part A — Exploring Waves
We started by discussing:
- What different types of waves exist (sound, light, radio, water).  
- The difference between **amplitude**, **frequency**, and **wavelength**.  
- Why humans can only hear certain frequencies.  
- How radio waves carry signals and what “frequency bands” mean.  

Simple classroom demonstrations and drawings helped visualise how waves move energy but not matter.

## Part B — Pass the Ghost
Participants then examined a short piece of radio code that let two micro:bits “pass a ghost” back and forth by shaking.  
They predicted what the program would do, tested it, and modified it to add sound effects and different icons.

> 💡 This activity linked coding logic (`if` tests and variables) to the real-world idea of transmitters and receivers.

## Part C — Quiz Recap
During the last 15–20 minutes, we revisited concepts from Weeks 1 and 2 through quiz questions and discussions, checking how much the group remembered about inputs, outputs, loops and events.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (or simulator)  
- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet access  
- Speakers or headphones for sound effects  
- Whiteboard or visuals to draw wave examples  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Keep cables tidy when participants move around testing radio code.  
- Use unique radio group numbers to avoid interference.  
- Monitor volume levels for sound experiments.
