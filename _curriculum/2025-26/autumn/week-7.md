## Week 7 ‚Äî Functions, Inputs & Space Invaders

**Focus Concept:** Functions and game logic  
**Mini-Projects:** *Function Challenges* ‚Üí *Mini Space Invaders*

This week we explored how **functions** can make our programs cleaner, faster to edit, and easier to reuse.  
Participants first created small examples of functions to see how they work, then applied the same ideas in a larger game that used the **accelerometer** and **collisions**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand what a **function** is and why we use it.  
- Create and call functions to group repeated actions.  
- Use **parameters** to make a function behave differently.  
- Explore how a function can return a result.  
- Apply loops, variables and conditions inside a larger game.  
- Control sprites using **buttons** and the **accelerometer**.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **function** does and when it runs.  
- I can create my own function that performs a short task.  
- I can add **parameters** so a function can change what it does.  
- I can describe how functions keep code tidy and reusable.  
- I can reuse my helper function in another project.  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Function** ‚Äî a mini-program that performs one job and can be reused.  
- **Call** ‚Äî the moment your program tells a function to run.  
- **Parameter** ‚Äî information passed *into* a function.  
- **Return** ‚Äî a value that a function sends *back*.  
- **Variable** ‚Äî a box that stores a number or word such as `score`, `speed`, or `level`.  
- **Condition** ‚Äî a true/false check that decides what happens next.  
- **Collision** ‚Äî when two sprites touch each other.

## Part A ‚Äî Function Challenges

### What We Explored
1. **Simple Function** ‚Äî a short reusable block (e.g. flash an icon, play a tone).  
   ‚Üí *Shows how to avoid repeating the same code.*

2. **Function with Parameter** ‚Äî takes input, such as how many times to flash or which icon to show.  
   ‚Üí *Same recipe, flexible results.*

3. **Function with Return Value** ‚Äî calculates something and gives the answer back (e.g. add two numbers).  
   ‚Üí *Lets other parts of the code use the result.*

4. **Combining Functions** ‚Äî several small helpers can work together, like one that displays a message and another that plays a sound.  
   ‚Üí *Builds the habit of modular thinking.*

> üí° *Functions are like reusable tools ‚Äî once built, you can use them in any project.*

### Try These Mini-Challenges
- Make a function `flash(times)` that blinks an icon a chosen number of times.  
- Create a function `showMessage(text)` that scrolls a message.  
- Write a function `addNumbers(a, b)` that returns their sum and shows it.  
- Combine two functions: one plays a tone, one flashes a light ‚Äî call both together for an alert effect.

## Part B ‚Äî Mini Space Invaders

### What We Built (Step-by-Step)
1. **Sprites:** created a `Ship` at the bottom and an `Alien` at the top.  
2. **Movement:** tilted the micro:bit left/right to move the ship; the alien moved sideways and bounced at the edges.  
3. **Shooting:** pressing B fired a `Laser` straight up; if it touched the alien, the alien disappeared, the score increased, and a new one spawned.  
4. **Bombs:** when the alien lined up with the ship, it dropped a `Bomb`; if the bomb touched the ship ‚Üí **Game Over**.  

> üîÑ *This project reused ideas from previous weeks ‚Äî loops, variables, collisions ‚Äî in a completely new style of gameplay.*

### Try These Mini-Challenges
- Randomise where the alien respawns (use `pick random 0 to 4`).  
- Add a ‚Äúlives‚Äù variable (e.g. 3 lives before Game Over).  
- Add a short **laser sound** each time you shoot.  
- Make the alien move faster each time you score 5 points.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (or simulator)  
- Chromebooks / laptops with internet  
- Optional: speakers or headphones for sound effects  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Keep USB cables tidy and test in the simulator first.  
- Work in pairs when debugging ‚Äî one reads code, one tests.  
- Save and name projects clearly before starting the new one.
