## Week 7 ‚Äî Functions, Levels & Space Invaders

**Focus Concept:** Functions and game logic  
**Mini-Projects:** *Advanced Barrel Jumper* ‚Üí *Mini Space Invaders*

This week we explored how a function can simplify our code and make games more dynamic.  
We first revisited *Barrel Jumper* to understand **levels** and **speed**, then built a brand-new game where the player uses the **accelerometer** to move and fire at an alien.

---

## Objectives
- Understand what a **function** is and why we use it.  
- Use **variables** and **maths** to change speed and difficulty.  
- Detect **collisions** and respond to them in different ways.  
- Control sprites using **buttons** and the **accelerometer**.  
- Recognise how the same coding ideas can create completely different games.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can describe what a **function** does and where I used one.  
- I can make a game get harder automatically as the **score** increases.  
- I can detect when two sprites **touch** and make something happen.  
- I can move sprites smoothly using loops, pauses, and conditions.  
- I can adapt familiar code to make a new type of game.  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Function** ‚Äî a mini-program that performs one job and can be reused.  
- **Variable** ‚Äî a box that stores a number or word such as `score`, `speed`, or `level`.  
- **Loop (forever)** ‚Äî repeats instructions over and over.  
- **Condition** ‚Äî a true/false check that decides what happens next.  
- **Collision** ‚Äî when two sprites touch each other.  
- **Respawn** ‚Äî recreate something (like a new alien) after it‚Äôs deleted.

## Part A ‚Äî Advanced Barrel Jumper

### What We Built (Step-by-Step)
1. **Game Loop:** keeps the barrel moving and checks for collisions with the jumper.  
2. **Jump Logic:** button B moves the jumper up 4 steps, then down 4, using two short loops.  
3. **Scoring & Speed:** each time the barrel reaches the edge, the score increases; every few points, the game speeds up slightly.  
4. **Level Function:** a function called `showLevelToast()` shows ‚ÄúL‚Äù + the current level and briefly pauses play ‚Äî our first example of reusable code.  

> üí° *This project introduced ‚Äúfunction‚Äù as a key programming idea: one neat block of code that we can call any time we need it.*

### Try These Mini-Challenges
- Change the level-up rule (every 3 points instead of 5).  
- Add a sound when the level changes.  
- Prevent the game from becoming *too fast* (minimum pause = 60 ms).  

---

## Part B ‚Äî Mini Space Invaders

### What We Built (Step-by-Step)
1. **Sprites:** created a `Ship` at the bottom and an `Alien` at the top.  
2. **Movement:** tilted the micro:bit left/right to move the ship; the alien moved sideways and bounced at the edges.  
3. **Shooting:** pressing B fired a `Laser` straight up; if it touched the alien, the alien disappeared, the score increased, and a new one spawned.  
4. **Bombs:** when the alien lined up with the ship, it dropped a `Bomb`; if the bomb touched the ship ‚Üí **Game Over**.  

> üîÑ *This project reused ideas from Barrel Jumper ‚Äî loops, variables, collisions ‚Äî in a completely new style of gameplay.*

### Try These Mini-Challenges
- Randomise where the alien respawns (use `pick random 0 to 4`).  
- Add a ‚Äúlives‚Äù variable (e.g. 3 lives before Game Over).  
- Add a short **laser sound** each time you shoot.  
- Make the alien move faster each time you score 5 points.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (or simulator)  
- Chromebooks / laptops with internet  
- Optional: speakers or headphones for sound effects  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Keep USB cables tidy and test in the simulator first.  
- Work in pairs when debugging ‚Äî one reads code, one tests.  
- Save and name projects clearly before starting the new one.
