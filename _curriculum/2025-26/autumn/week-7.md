## Week 7 ‚Äî Functions, Levels & Space Invaders

**Focus Concept:** Functions and game logic  
**Mini-Projects:** *Function Challenges* ‚Üí *Mini Space Invaders*

This week we explored how **functions** help us keep code tidy and reusable.  
We first built and tested small examples of functions ‚Äî from simple ones that just run a few lines, to ones that use **inputs** (parameters) or even **return** results.  
After learning how they work, we revisited *Barrel Jumper* to see how a function can show the **level** or **speed-up** message, and then moved on to a new challenge game using the **accelerometer**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand what a **function** is and why we use it.  
- Create and call simple functions to group repeated actions.  
- Use **parameters** to make a function work in different ways.  
- Recognise how a function can simplify larger games.  
- Detect **collisions** and respond with variables and conditions.  
- Control sprites using **buttons** and the **accelerometer**.  

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what a **function** does and when it runs.  
- I can create a function that repeats an action or shows a message.  
- I can use a **parameter** inside a function to change how it behaves.  
- I can describe how functions make my program easier to read.  
- I can reuse my function in a different part of the game.  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Function** ‚Äî a mini-program that performs one job and can be reused.  
- **Call** ‚Äî the moment your program tells a function to run.  
- **Parameter** ‚Äî information passed *into* a function.  
- **Return** ‚Äî a value that a function sends *back*.  
- **Variable** ‚Äî a box that stores a number or word such as `score`, `speed`, or `level`.  
- **Condition** ‚Äî a true/false check that decides what happens next.  
- **Collision** ‚Äî when two sprites touch each other.

## Part A ‚Äî Function Challenges & Barrel Jumper Extension

### What We Explored
1. **Static Function:**  
   A short function that performs a single action when called, for example flashing an icon or showing a message.  
   ‚Üí *Helps remove repeated code.*

2. **Function with Parameter:**  
   A reusable version that accepts an **input**, such as the number of flashes or the level to show.  
   ‚Üí *Same code, flexible results.*

3. **Function with Return Value:**  
   A more advanced example where the function works out an answer (for example adding two numbers) and **returns** it to be used later.  
   ‚Üí *Used to pass information back into the program.*

4. **Applying It in Games:**  
   In *Advanced Barrel Jumper*, we used a function to display a ‚ÄúLevel Up‚Äù message whenever the score reached a multiple of 5.  
   The function could also play a short tone or slow down the barrel briefly before restarting the game loop.

> üí° *Functions keep your code neat ‚Äî write once, use many times!*

### Try These Mini-Challenges
- Make a function `flash(times)` that blinks an icon a chosen number of times.  
- Create a function `showLevel(level)` that prints the level number and plays a sound.  
- Modify the Barrel Jumper project so that the level-up rule changes automatically (for example, every 3 points).  
- Prevent the game from becoming *too fast* by adding a minimum delay in your loop.

## Part B ‚Äî Mini Space Invaders

### What We Built (Step-by-Step)
1. **Sprites:** created a `Ship` at the bottom and an `Alien` at the top.  
2. **Movement:** tilted the micro:bit left/right to move the ship; the alien moved sideways and bounced at the edges.  
3. **Shooting:** pressing B fired a `Laser` straight up; if it touched the alien, the alien disappeared, the score increased, and a new one spawned.  
4. **Bombs:** when the alien lined up with the ship, it dropped a `Bomb`; if the bomb touched the ship ‚Üí **Game Over**.  

> üîÑ *This project reused ideas from Barrel Jumper ‚Äî loops, variables, collisions ‚Äî in a completely new style of gameplay.*

### Try These Mini-Challenges
- Randomise where the alien respawns (use `pick random 0 to 4`).  
- Add a ‚Äúlives‚Äù variable (e.g. 3 lives before Game Over).  
- Add a short **laser sound** each time you shoot.  
- Make the alien move faster each time you score 5 points.

## Equipment
- BBC micro:bits + USB cables (or simulator)  
- Chromebooks / laptops with internet  
- Optional: speakers or headphones for sound effects  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Keep USB cables tidy and test in the simulator first.  
- Work in pairs when debugging ‚Äî one reads code, one tests.  
- Save and name projects clearly before starting the new one.
