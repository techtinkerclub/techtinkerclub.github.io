# Spring 2026 — Tinkercad Term: Curriculum Links

This page summarises how the **Spring 2026 Tinkercad term** connects to the KS2 curriculum.

---

## KS2 Computing

**Creating Media (3D and Digital Content)**  
- Learners use Tinkercad to create and edit 3D content with a clear audience and purpose (name tags, characters, towers, vehicles).  
- They select tools (move, scale, rotate, align, group, holes, Sketch, Revolve) appropriately and explain what each does.  

**Programming & Logical Thinking (through SimLab and structured design)**  
- SimLab activities introduce simple ideas from programming and modelling: cause and effect, rules, parameters (e.g. ramp angle) and outcomes.  
- Pupils learn to predict what will happen, test it, then update their design based on the result (a basic form of “debugging”).  

**Problem Solving & Computational Thinking**  
- Across the term, learners break problems into smaller steps (e.g. build base → add details → test).  
- They use repetition and symmetry tools (duplicate, mirror) as manual equivalents of loops and pattern generation.

## KS2 Design & Technology

**Design**  
- Pupils work to simple design briefs:  
  - *Week 1:* a readable name tag / keyring.  
  - *Week 2:* a simple character token.  
  - *Week 3–4:* stamps, patterns and symmetric creatures/rockets.  
  - *Week 5:* a revolved product (cup, rocket body, pendant).  
  - *Week 7–10:* car bodies and towers with constraints (motion, stability, simulated earthquakes).  
- They consider users (self, friend, classroom) and real‑world context (tag size, strength, readability).

**Make**  
- Pupils select virtual tools and techniques to shape, join and refine their products.  
- They practise measuring in millimetres, aligning parts, creating holes and mirroring components.  

**Evaluate**  
- After testing in SimLab, learners describe what worked, what failed and what they changed.  
- In Week 10, they present a final design and reflect on improvements made over the term.

**Technical Knowledge**  
- Basic understanding of how shape and material thickness relate to strength.  
- Simple mechanical ideas: wheels, axles and how friction affects motion (Weeks 6–8).  
- Structural ideas: wide bases, bracing and centre of mass for tall towers (Week 9).

## KS2 Maths

- **Number & Measurement:**  
  - Use millimetres as standard units in Tinkercad.  
  - Compare lengths, heights and thicknesses (e.g. ramp length, wall thickness).  
- **Geometry – Properties of Shape:**  
  - Explore 3D shapes (prisms, cylinders, spheres) and nets indirectly through modelling.  
  - Use symmetry and rotation (mirror tools, revolve profiles).  
- **Geometry – Position & Direction:**  
  - Interpret movement in 3D space using x, y, z axes and camera controls.  
- **Statistics & Reasoning (informal):**  
  - Compare outcomes in SimLab experiments (which car went furthest, which tower survived longer).

## Science & Engineering Links

- **Forces & Motion (Weeks 6–8):**  
  - Gravity pulling objects down ramps.  
  - Friction helping or hindering sliding/rolling.  
  - Collisions and simple observations of speed and distance.  
- **Materials & Structures (Weeks 3–5 & 9):**  
  - Thinking about wall thickness, brittle vs sturdy shapes.  
  - Towers with wide vs narrow bases; the effect of bracing triangles.  
- **Working Scientifically:**  
  - Making predictions, running tests, observing outcomes and suggesting improvements.

---

## Art & Design

- **Visual Communication:**  
  - Using shape, colour, pattern and symmetry to make designs more readable and appealing.  
- **Identity & Personalisation:**  
  - Name tags, characters and pendants that reflect learners’ interests, roles or favourite themes.  
- **Iterative Making:**  
  - Encouraging rough ideas first, then refinement (e.g. rocket or car over multiple weeks).  

---

## PSHE, Teamwork & Oracy

- **Collaboration:**  
  - Learners often work in pairs or small groups to share ideas, give feedback and debug designs.  
- **Resilience & Growth Mindset:**  
  - SimLab experiments make “failure” safe and visible; pupils are encouraged to treat it as information, not a problem.  
- **Speaking & Listening:**  
  - Weekly quick “show and tell” moments help pupils practise explaining their work and listening to others.

## Overview: Where Things Happen

- **Weeks 1–5:** Core CAD skills — navigation, shapes, holes, symmetry, Sketch & Revolve.  
- **Weeks 6–8:** Motion and vehicles — ramps, friction and simple car designs, tested in SimLab.  
- **Weeks 9–10:** Structures and final projects — stable towers, earthquake simulations and improved best‑of‑term designs.
