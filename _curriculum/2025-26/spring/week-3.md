This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Mini Box & Peg Fit Test* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Ruler** — a tool that shows exact measurements of shapes in the workspace.
- **Units (millimetres)** — the small length units used in Tinkercad for real‑world sizing.
- **Workplane** — a temporary flat surface placed on a face to help you build from the right direction.
- **Dimension** — a measured length, width or height of a shape.
- **Tolerance** — the small size difference that helps two parts slide or fit together.

---

## Part A — Explore Precision Tools
- Turn the ruler on and off and read key measurements.
- Change grid settings and notice how snap affects movement.

## Part B — Make: Box & Peg
- Design a simple box and a matching peg with a small clearance.
- Talk about which part you make slightly bigger or smaller so they fit.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Label important dimensions with text shapes.
- Optional: Sketch ideas for a lid or second peg if time allows.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
