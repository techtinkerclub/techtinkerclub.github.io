This week’s session focuses on **holes** and **negative space**. Participants learn how to turn shapes into holes and use them to cut letters or symbols out of a solid object, creating a simple stamp or “cutter”.

---

## Objectives

- Turn normal shapes into **holes** and use them to remove material.  
- Design a simple stamp or cutter that has a clear, recognisable cut‑out.  
- Think about thickness so the design is strong enough for printing.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can use hole shapes to cut out parts of another shape.  
- I can create a design where the cut‑out is easy to see and understand.  
- I can avoid making walls or details so thin that they might break.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Hole** — a shape in Tinkercad that removes material when grouped with a solid.  
- **Negative Space** — the empty space that makes a shape (e.g. the gap that forms a letter).  
- **Clearance** — the space left around a detail so it prints or stands out clearly.  

---

## Part A — Explore Hole Tool

- Show how to select a shape and mark it as a **hole**.  
- Demonstrate grouping a solid and a hole to create a cut‑out.  
- Let participants practise cutting simple shapes (e.g. star or letter) from a box.  

---

## Part B — Make: Stamp / Cutter

- Ask learners to choose a simple motif: a letter, number, or simple icon.  
- Build a base plate and use hole shapes to cut the motif from the surface.  
- Encourage them to check from multiple angles that the cut‑out is clear.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Add a handle or extra border to make the stamp easier to hold.  
- Share designs and ask: “What does your stamp show? How did you make it stand out?”

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse for each device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- If you are planning to print, remind learners that deep, narrow holes can trap support material or be hard to clean.  
- Encourage them to keep the model footprint reasonable so it prints in a sensible time.
