## Week 8 — Make the Car Move (SimLab)

**Focus Concept:** Using SimLab to test a simple car design  
**Mini-Project:** *Car Motion Test & Improvements*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using simulation to test a CAD design before making it.</li>
    <li><strong>Science:</strong> Observing how friction, slopes and collisions affect motion.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Improving a prototype based on test results.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Comparing distances travelled and simple timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Thinking about centre of mass and how smooth a design is.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This week participants load their car body into **SimLab**, add simple wheels or supports, and test how well it moves down a ramp or across a surface.

---

## Objectives

- Import or recreate the Week 7 car body in SimLab.  
- Build a simple scene where the car can move (e.g. ramp and ground).  
- Observe how design changes affect motion.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can set up a simple scene where my car moves.  
- I can describe what went wrong (e.g. tipping, getting stuck).  
- I can improve my design after testing.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Simulation** — using a computer model to see how something behaves.  
- **Friction** — the force that slows down motion when surfaces touch.  
- **Centre of mass** — a “balance point” that affects whether something tips.  

---

## Part A — Bring the Car into SimLab

- Show how to open the car design in SimLab or build a simplified version there.  
- Add a ramp and a flat surface at the bottom.  

---

## Part B — Make: Car Motion Tests

- Test the car on the ramp and watch what happens.  
- If the car tips or gets stuck, adjust shape, wheel position or ramp steepness.  
- Repeat tests, aiming to reach the bottom smoothly.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Try a simple “distance challenge”: whose car travels furthest?  
- Ask: “What small change made the biggest difference to how your car moved?”

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- Encourage saving regularly in case simulations become messy and need resetting.  
- Keep scenes simple so simulations run smoothly and are easy to understand.
