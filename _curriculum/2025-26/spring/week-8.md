This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Patterned Bracelet or Tower* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Codeblocks** — Tinkercad’s block‑based coding area for generating 3D models.
- **Loop** — a code structure that repeats a set of instructions many times.
- **Parameter** — a number or setting you can change to adjust a design.
- **Repeat** — a block that runs the same code several times.
- **Transform** — a change made to a shape, such as moving, rotating or scaling it.

---

## Part A — Explore Codeblocks
- Use Codeblocks to place a simple shape in a line using a repeat block.
- Change a parameter, like step distance or angle, to see the pattern shift.

## Part B — Make: Patterned Model
- Create a bracelet, ring or tower by repeating and rotating shapes.
- Export to the normal design workspace if there is time to refine details.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Swap designs with a partner and change one parameter to create a variant.
- Discuss how parametric design helps change designs quickly.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
