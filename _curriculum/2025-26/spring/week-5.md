## Week 5 — Sketch & Revolve (2D → 3D)

**Focus Concept:** Using Sketch and Revolve to create smooth curved 3D forms  
**Mini-Project:** *Revolved Rocket / Pendant*

This week participants use the **Sketch** tool to draw a 2D profile, then use **Revolve** to spin it into a 3D shape such as a rocket body, bottle or pendant.

---

## Objectives

- Create a simple, closed **profile sketch**.  
- Use **Revolve** to turn that sketch into a solid 3D object.  
- Adjust proportions so the final model looks sensible and stable.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can draw a profile that Revolve can turn into a solid shape.  
- I can choose a good axis and angle for the revolve.  
- I can tweak my design so it looks intentional and usable.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Sketch** — a 2D drawing used as the basis for a 3D model.  
- **Profile** — the outline that will be revolved.  
- **Revolve** — spin a profile around an axis to make a 3D object.  
- **Axis** — the line the sketch spins around.  

---

## Part A — Explore Sketch

- Demonstrate how to open the Sketch tool and draw a simple side‑on outline.  
- Show how to make sure the profile is **closed** (no gaps).  
- Let participants practise drawing a basic cup or rocket profile.  

---

## Part B — Make: Revolved Rocket / Pendant

- Learners choose whether to design a small rocket body, bottle, cup or pendant.  
- They draw a profile, then use **Revolve** to create the 3D form.  
- Adjust scale and proportions to make the design look practical.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Add small extra details (fins, loop for pendant, simple base) using normal Tinkercad shapes.  
- Invite learners to show their profile and final 3D shape side by side.

## Resources

- **Tinkercad — Sketch & Revolve overview:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/sketch-revolve>  
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  

---

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- For prints, avoid very thin edges or sharp points that could snap or be uncomfortable to touch.  
- Remind learners to keep model sizes sensible to avoid long print times.
