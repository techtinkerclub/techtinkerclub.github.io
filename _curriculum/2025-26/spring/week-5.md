## Week 5 — Shape Generators & Scribble

**Focus Concept:** Custom forms using shape generators and Scribble  
**Mini-Project:** *Custom Badge or Pendant*

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Custom Badge or Pendant* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Shape generator** — a special shape whose form changes when you adjust sliders or numbers.
- **Parameters** — the values you change to control a generator’s size, count or pattern.
- **Scribble** — a tool that turns a hand‑drawn outline into a 3D shape.
- **Profile** — the outline or side‑view shape that helps define an object.

---

## Part A — Explore Generators & Scribble
- Adjust a shape generator’s parameters to see how the form changes.
- Use Scribble to draw a simple outline and turn it into a 3D piece.

## Part B — Make: Badge or Pendant
- Combine generators and standard shapes to form a base.
- Add raised text or symbols and a hole for a chain or lanyard.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Discuss which features might be too thin or fragile when printed.
- Optional: Design a second version that is stronger or simpler.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
