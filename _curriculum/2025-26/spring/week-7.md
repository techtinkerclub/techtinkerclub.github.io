## Week 7 — Print Preparation

**Focus Concept:** Preparing models for 3D printing safely and successfully  
**Mini-Project:** *Desk Nameplate or Phone Stand*

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Desk Nameplate or Phone Stand* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **STL** — a common 3D file format used for sending models to a 3D printer.
- **OBJ** — another 3D file format that can store more complex model information.
- **Wall thickness** — how thick the outer walls of a model are, which affects strength.
- **Overhang** — a part of a model that sticks out with nothing directly underneath it.
- **Support** — temporary printed material that holds up overhangs during printing.
- **Orientation** — the direction a model is turned on the build plate for printing.

---

## Part A — Explore Export & Checks
- Export a simple model as STL and talk about what happens next in slicing.
- Look at examples of good and bad orientations for printing.

## Part B — Make: Nameplate or Stand
- Design a stable base that will not tip over easily.
- Add readable text or a simple motif and consider wall thickness.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Optional: Add chamfers or fillets to reduce sharp edges and improve strength.
- Create or update a print queue list for future sessions.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
