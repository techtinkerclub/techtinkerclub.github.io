## Week 7 — CAD: Design a Simple Car Body

**Focus Concept:** Using 3D tools to design a car body ready for testing  
**Mini-Project:** *4‑Wheel Car Design*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Combining multiple CAD tools to make a purposeful model.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Designing for a user and for movement (a simple car).</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Measuring length, width and wheel spacing.</li>
    <li><strong>Science:</strong> Linking shape and friction to how something might move.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Thinking about where axles and wheels will go.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Building on the last six weeks, participants design a **simple car body** that can later be tested in SimLab.

## Objectives

- Use align, group, holes and duplicate to shape a car body.  
- Leave space for **four wheels** (even if wheels are not modelled in detail yet).  
- Keep the design balanced and reasonably symmetric.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can design a body shape that clearly looks like a car.  
- I can show where four wheels would attach.  
- I can keep the car roughly symmetric so it should move straight.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Chassis** — the main frame or body of a vehicle.  
- **Axle** — a bar that wheels spin around (mentioned conceptually).  
- **Wheelbase** — the distance between front and back wheels.  

---

## Part A — Plan & Sketch

- Briefly sketch (on paper or verbally) what the car body might look like.  
- Highlight where the wheels will go and what sort of user it is for.  

---

## Part B — Make: Car Body

- Use boxes and other simple shapes to form the main chassis.  
- Use **holes** to cut out wheel arches or gaps where wheels could fit.  
- Use **duplicate and mirror** to keep left and right sides matching.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Add small extra details (windows, spoiler, headlights) without making the design fragile.  
- Ask learners to show where they expect the car to touch the ground and where the wheels would sit.  

---

## Resources

- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  

---

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- If you plan to print any car bodies, remind learners to avoid long, thin spikes or sharp edges.  
- Keep car sizes sensible so they could be printed in a reasonable time.
