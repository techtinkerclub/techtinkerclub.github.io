## Week 7 — Import/Export & Print Prep

**Focus Concept:** Preparing models for 3D printing safely and successfully  
**Mini-Project:** *Desk Nameplate or Phone Stand*

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants will complete a **mini-project** — *Desk Nameplate or Phone Stand* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use the week’s core tools in Tinkercad.
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model.
- Share, discuss, and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help, if needed).

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **STL**
- **OBJ**
- **wall thickness**
- **overhang**
- **support**
- **orientation**

---

## Part A — Explore Export & Checks
- Export STL and inspect for very thin walls (teacher demo).
- Choose orientations that reduce supports.
## Part B — Make: Stand/Nameplate
- Design with stable base and readable text.
- Add fillets or chamfers for strength.
## Part C — Extend & Share
- Optional logo or school crest outline.
- Create a print queue list together.

---

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

---

## Equipment
- Laptops/Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit/pan/zoom)
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models
- Headphones (if watching short videos)

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing/printing; only adults operate printers.
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap.
- Encourage careful mouse/keyboard use and screen breaks.
