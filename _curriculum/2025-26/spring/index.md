# Spring 2026 — Tinkercad Term

**Theme:** *“Design, Make, Iterate.”*  
Each week introduces a small, focused **mini-project**, building skills step by step and ending in a **capstone showcase**.

---

## Intent (What we want to achieve)
- Build confidence using digital 3D tools to design purposeful products.  
- Apply measurement, symmetry, and simple parameters to improve designs.  
- Understand constraints for 3D printing (thickness, orientation, supports).  
- Experience iteration: make → test (virtually) → improve → present.

---

## Implementation (How we will do it)
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** throughout Spring.  
- Each week introduces a **new design idea** inside a **mini-project**.  
- Projects are tiered for mixed-ability access and extension.  
- Plans may adapt depending on time, resources, or group interests.

---

## Impact (How we’ll know it worked)
- Pupils explain design choices using correct vocabulary.  
- Models meet simple briefs and show at least one iteration.  
- Selected models prepared for safe printing and a small showcase.
