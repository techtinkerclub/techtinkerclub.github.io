# Spring 2026 — Tinkercad Term

**Theme:** *“Design, Make, Iterate.”*  
This term, participants at Tech Tinker Club will use Tinkercad to design 3D models, explore mechanisms and simple circuits, and prepare a small number of projects for 3D printing or digital showcase.

---

## Intent (What we want to achieve)
- Build confidence using digital 3D tools to design purposeful products.  
- Apply measurement, symmetry and simple parameters to improve designs.  
- Help children understand basic constraints for 3D printing (thickness, orientation, supports).  
- Encourage iteration: make → test (virtually) → improve → present.  

---

## Implementation (How we will do it)
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** throughout the Spring term.  
- Each week introduces a **new design idea** inside a **small mini-project**.  
- Activities are tiered so that beginners can follow a guided path while confident learners extend and personalise.  
- Plans may adapt depending on time, resources or the group’s interests.

---

## Impact (How we’ll know it worked)
- Pupils can explain design choices using correct vocabulary (e.g. workplane, symmetry, tolerance).  
- Models broadly meet simple briefs and show at least one improvement after feedback.  
- Selected models are prepared for safe 3D printing or presented clearly as digital artefacts.
