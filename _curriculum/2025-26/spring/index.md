# Spring 2026 — Tinkercad Term

**Theme:** *“Design, Make, Iterate.”*  
This term, participants at Tech Tinker Club will use Tinkercad to design 3D models, explore mechanisms and test simple structures in **SimLab**. The focus is on thoughtful design: planning, making, testing and improving.

## Intent (What we want to achieve)

- Build confidence using **digital 3D tools** to design purposeful products.  
- Help children think like designers: **Who is this for? What problem does it solve?**  
- Introduce simple ideas from **mechanics and structures** (motion, friction, stability).  
- Encourage iteration: **make → test (virtually) → improve → present.**  

---

## Implementation (How we will do it)

- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** throughout the Spring term.  
- Each week introduces a **focus concept** through a **small, guided mini‑project**.  
- Activities are **tiered**, so beginners can follow a clear path while confident learners extend and personalise.  
- SimLab is used in the second half of term to test designs **virtually** before any real making.  

---

## Impact (How we’ll know it worked)

- Pupils can explain design choices using correct vocabulary (e.g. workplane, symmetry, stability, friction).  
- Models broadly meet simple briefs and show at least one improvement after feedback or testing.  
- Pupils can describe how **testing in SimLab** changed their design ideas.  
- Selected models may be prepared for safe 3D printing or presented clearly as digital artefacts.

## Looking ahead

- **Summer 2026:** Integration term — combining micro:bit coding, 3D design and (later) simple circuits into small, purposeful projects.
