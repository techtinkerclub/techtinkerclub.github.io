## Week 10 — Final Project (Structured Choice)

**Focus Concept:** Planning, improving and presenting a chosen design  
**Mini-Project:** *Improved Car / Tower / Rocket*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using Tinkercad and SimLab (where appropriate) to refine a design.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Following a simple brief and iterating a product.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Adjusting measurements, proportions and comparisons.</li>
    <li><strong>Science &amp; Engineering:</strong> Applying ideas about strength, motion or stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Art &amp; Design:</strong> Finishing touches, colour and presentation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

In the final week, participants choose one of the term’s themes — **car**, **tower**, or **rocket / revolved object** — and create an improved, “best‑of‑term” version of their design.

---

## Objectives

- Choose a focus (car, tower or rocket / revolved object).  
- Plan at least one clear improvement to make.  
- Build, test (where appropriate) and present the final design.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can explain which design I chose and why.  
- I can describe at least one improvement I made.  
- I can talk about how my design links to motion or stability.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Iterate** — improve a design through small changes.  
- **Prototype** — an early version of a design used for testing.  
- **Brief** — a simple description of what the design should do.  

---

## Part A — Plan

- Offer three structured choices:  
  - **Car:** improve motion or shape.  
  - **Tower:** improve stability in SimLab.  
  - **Rocket / Revolved object:** improve shape, detail or practicality.  
- Ask learners to quickly sketch or explain what they will change.  

---

## Part B — Make & Test

- Give most of the session for building and refining.  
- Cars and towers can be tested in **SimLab** to check motion or earthquake performance.  
- Rockets or pendants can be checked for sensible thickness and proportions.  

---

## Part C — Share & Reflect

- Run a short, informal “show and tell” where each participant presents:  
  - their chosen project  
  - the main change they made  
  - what worked well and what they would try next.  

---

## Resources

- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Tinkercad SimLab overview:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/simlab>  

---

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  
- Optional: 3D printer access for a small number of chosen models  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- If printing, follow school policies on what objects are appropriate (no weapons or unsafe shapes).  
- Encourage kind, constructive feedback during sharing.
