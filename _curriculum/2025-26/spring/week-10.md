This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Final Print or Best‑of‑Term Model* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Prototype** — a first version of a product used to test ideas and improvements.
- **Iteration** — making small changes and improvements to a design over several versions.
- **Evaluate** — look carefully at a design to decide what works well and what needs changing.
- **Brief** — a short description of what a design should do and who it is for.
- **Audience** — the people who will use or look at your final product.

---

## Part A — Plan & Iterate
- Choose a favourite model from the term or start a small new one based on a short brief.
- Decide one or two changes that would make the design better for its audience.

## Part B — Make: Finalise & Export
- Update the design, then prepare it for printing or for display on screen.
- Create a simple one‑slide poster or title card to introduce the model.

## Part C — Showcase & Reflect
- Share models in a mini‑gallery or short presentations.
- Reflect on what skills were gained from Autumn’s Micro:bit term to Spring’s Tinkercad term.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
