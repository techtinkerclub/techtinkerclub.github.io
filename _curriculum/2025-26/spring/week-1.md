## Week 1 — Welcome to 3D Design

**Focus Concept:** 3D space (x/y/z), navigation, placing and resizing shapes  
**Mini-Project:** *Personal Name Tag or Keyring*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using a digital 3D environment and (in Week 8) Codeblocks to generate geometry.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Iterating models to meet a brief; thinking about materials and print constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Measurement in millimetres, symmetry, and simple parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Art &amp; Design:</strong> Aesthetics, colour choices, and visual balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Strength, stability, and how parts fit together.</li>

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants will complete a **mini-project** — *Personal Name Tag or Keyring* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use the week’s core tools in Tinkercad.
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model.
- Share, discuss, and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help, if needed).

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **3D workspace**
- **orbit**
- **pan**
- **zoom**
- **shape**
- **resize**
- **grid**
- **snap**

---

## Part A — Explore 3D Space
- Tour the Tinkercad workspace (navigation mouse/trackpad).
- Identify x/y/z axes and how the view cube works.
## Part B — Make: Name Tag / Keyring
- Place basic shapes and text.
- Resize and nudge; add a hole for the ring.
## Part C — Extend & Share
- Add colours and simple decorations.
- Export STL (teacher demo only).

---

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

---

## Equipment
- Laptops/Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit/pan/zoom)
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models
- Headphones (if watching short videos)

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing/printing; only adults operate printers.
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap.
- Encourage careful mouse/keyboard use and screen breaks.
