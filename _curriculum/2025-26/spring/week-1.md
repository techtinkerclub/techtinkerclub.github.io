## Week 1 — 3D Basics & Navigation

**Focus Concept:** 3D space, camera controls and simple shapes  
**Mini-Project:** *Name Tag / Keyring*

This week is all about getting comfortable in **3D space**. Participants learn how to orbit, pan and zoom, then place, resize and combine a few simple shapes to make a personalised **name tag or keyring**.

---

## Objectives

- Understand that Tinkercad is a **3D space** with x, y and z directions.  
- Use **orbit, pan and zoom** to look at a model from different angles.  
- Place and resize basic shapes on the workplane.  
- Combine a base shape and text to create a simple name tag or keyring.

---

## Success Criteria

- I can move the camera to see my model from different sides.  
- I can place shapes on the workplane and change their size.  
- I can make a name tag or keyring that clearly shows a name or initials.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Orbit** — moving the camera around a model to see it from different sides.  
- **Pan** — sliding the camera left, right, up or down.  
- **Zoom** — moving the camera closer to or further from a model.  
- **Workplane** — the flat “floor” where you place shapes.  
- **Group** — joining shapes together so they move as one object.  

---

## Part A — Explore the 3D Space

- Show the difference between **orbit, pan and zoom** using a simple cube.  
- Let participants drop a few shapes onto the workplane and practise looking at them from different angles.  
- Highlight how the **view cube** and **home view** buttons help if they feel “lost”.  

---

## Part B — Make: Name Tag / Keyring

- Add a flat base shape (box or cylinder) and resize it so it could fit as a small tag.  
- Add **text shapes** for a name or initials; resize so the text is readable.  
- Optional: add a small cylinder or hole near the edge for a keyring loop.  

> Encourage them to think about a real user — themselves, a friend or a family member.

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Add one or two simple decorations (symbols, small shapes) without over‑complicating the model.  
- Invite a quick “mini gallery” where learners show their tag and explain who it is for.

## Resources

- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Tinkercad Lessons — Getting started:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mouse for each device (highly recommended)  
- Projector or large screen for live demo  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- Check logins before the session so time is not lost.  
- Encourage good posture and short breaks from the screen when needed.  
- If you plan to print later, remind participants that tiny details might not print well.
