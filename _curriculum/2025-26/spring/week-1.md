## Week 1 — Welcome to 3D Design

**Focus Concept:** 3D space (x/y/z), navigation, placing and resizing shapes  
**Mini-Project:** *Personal Name Tag or Keyring*

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Personal Name Tag or Keyring* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).

## Key Vocabulary
- **3D workspace** — the virtual space where you place and move 3D shapes.
- **Orbit** — moving the camera around your model to see it from different sides.
- **Pan** — sliding the view left, right, up or down without rotating it.
- **Zoom** — moving the camera closer to or further from the model.
- **Shape** — a 3D object like a box, cylinder or sphere used to build models.
- **Resize** — change the size of a shape by stretching or shrinking it.
- **Grid** — the pattern of lines on the workplane that helps you measure and line things up.
- **Snap** — a setting that makes shapes move or resize in fixed steps, like 1 mm at a time.

---

## Part A — Explore 3D Space
- Tour the Tinkercad workspace (view cube, orbit, pan, zoom).
- Identify the X, Y and Z axes and how the workplane sits in 3D space.

## Part B — Make: Name Tag or Keyring
- Place basic shapes and text to create a simple tag.
- Resize shapes and add a hole so it can go on a keyring or lanyard.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Add colours or small decorations that don’t make the tag too fragile.
- Show designs to a partner and give one suggestion for improvement.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
