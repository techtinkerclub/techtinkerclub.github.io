## Week 6 — Motion, Gravity & Friction (SimLab)

**Focus Concept:** Exploring how objects slide, roll and collide in Tinkercad SimLab  
**Mini-Project:** *Sliding & Rolling Experiments*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using a physics simulation tool (SimLab) to test designs virtually.</li>
    <li><strong>Science:</strong> Observing forces, gravity, friction and collisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Testing shapes and surfaces before making real models.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Comparing distances, speeds and slopes informally.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Thinking about which shapes move smoothly and which get stuck.</li>
  </ul>

This week introduces **Tinkercad SimLab**. Instead of building something to print, participants build simple test rigs and watch how shapes slide, roll and bump into each other.

## Objectives

- Open a design in **SimLab** and run a basic simulation.  
- Compare how different shapes move (sliding vs rolling).  
- Talk about gravity and friction using simple language.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can start a SimLab simulation and watch it play.  
- I can say whether an object slid, rolled or toppled — and why.  
- I can tweak my design (e.g. ramp angle or shape) to change the motion.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **SimLab** — Tinkercad’s physics simulation space.  
- **Gravity** — the force that pulls things down.  
- **Friction** — the force that slows sliding and rolling surfaces.  
- **Ramp** — a sloping surface that changes height gradually.  

---

## Part A — Explore SimLab

- Show how to switch from normal Tinkercad into **SimLab** for a simple scene.  
- Drop a block and a cylinder onto a ramp and predict what will happen.  
- Run the simulation and compare with predictions.  

---

## Part B — Make: Sliding & Rolling Experiments

- Let learners build their own small ramps and obstacle courses.  
- Test different shapes (cubes, cylinders, spheres) and observe how they move.  
- Encourage them to make small changes (steeper ramp, rougher surface, different shapes) and test again.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Try simple “races”: which object reaches the bottom first?  
- Ask: “What changed when you made the ramp steeper?” or “Which shape rolls best and why?”

## Resources

- **Tinkercad SimLab overview:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/simlab>  
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  

---

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- Make clear that this is a **virtual** experiment, but ideas link to real‑world ramps and rolling objects.  
- Encourage learners to run short simulations and reset often, rather than making huge, complex scenes that become confusing.
