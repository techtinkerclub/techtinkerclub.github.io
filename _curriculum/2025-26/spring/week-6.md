This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants will complete a **mini-project** — *Spinning Top or Wheel & Axle Toy* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use the week’s core tools in Tinkercad.
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model.
- Share, discuss, and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help, if needed).

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **axle**
- **hub**
- **clearance**
- **friction**
- **bearing** — simple

---

## Part A — Explore Motion-by-Design
- Difference between hole size and axle diameter.
- Where friction helps or hinders.
## Part B — Make: Spinner/Wheel
- Design a central hub and balanced spokes.
- Test variants (teacher demo preview).
## Part C — Extend & Share
- Optional cap or handle.
- Discuss durability (layer direction).

---

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

---

## Equipment
- Laptops/Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit/pan/zoom)
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models
- Headphones (if watching short videos)

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing/printing; only adults operate printers.
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap.
- Encourage careful mouse/keyboard use and screen breaks.
