This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Spinning Top or Wheel & Axle Toy* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).

## Key Vocabulary
- **Axle** — a rod or shaft that a wheel or other part spins around.
- **Hub** — the central part of a wheel that connects to the axle.
- **Clearance** — the extra space between parts so they can move without rubbing.
- **Friction** — the force that resists motion when two surfaces touch.
- **Bearing (simple)** — a simple way of supporting an axle so it can spin more smoothly.

---

## Part A — Explore Motion by Design
- Compare a tight fit and a loose fit around an axle.
- Discuss when friction is helpful (staying in place) and when it gets in the way (spinning).

## Part B — Make: Spinner or Wheel Toy
- Design a central hub with an axle and balanced arms or a wheel shape.
- Think about where to leave clearance so the parts can move.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Optional: Add a small handle or cap so it is easier to spin.
- Talk about which parts might wear out first if heavily used.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
