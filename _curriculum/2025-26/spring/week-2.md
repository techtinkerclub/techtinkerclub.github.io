This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Stamp or Cutter (not for real food)* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Align** — a precision tool that lines shapes up neatly along an axis.
- **Group** — join shapes together so they behave as one object.
- **Ungroup** — split a grouped object back into separate shapes.
- **Hole** — a special cutting shape used to remove material from another shape.
- **Solid** — a normal 3D shape that adds material to your model.
- **Boolean operation** — a way of adding or cutting shapes by combining solids and holes.

---

## Part A — Explore Align & Group
- Practise aligning shapes along the X, Y and Z axes.
- Group and ungroup shapes to see how they combine and separate.

## Part B — Make: Stamp or Cutter
- Use text or a simple icon shape to create a raised or recessed pattern.
- Add a handle or base so it is easy to push down.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Try curved shapes (like cylinders) for the base.
- Discuss why we do not use these prints with real food at school.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
