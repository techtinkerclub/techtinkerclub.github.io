## Week 2 — Align & Group (Character Design)

**Focus Concept:** Aligning, grouping and arranging shapes to make a simple character  
**Mini-Project:** *Simple Character*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using alignment tools to control layout rather than “eyeballing”.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Building up a product (a character token) from parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Symmetry and spacing between features.</li>
    <li><strong>Art &amp; Design:</strong> Expression, proportion and visual style.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Keeping bases flat and stable so the model can stand or sit on a surface.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This week, participants use **align** and **group** to place eyes, mouth and other features accurately, building a simple 3D character.

## Objectives

- Use the **align** tool to position features accurately.  
- **Group** shapes to form a single object.  
- Design and build a simple character with a clear face and body.

---

## Success Criteria

- I can use the align tool to centre or line up shapes.  
- I can group shapes so they move as one.  
- I can design a simple character whose features are spaced sensibly.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Align** — line shapes up along edges or centres.  
- **Group** — join shapes together so they behave like one object.  
- **Symmetry** — when two sides of something match in shape and size.  

---

## Part A — Explore Align & Group

- Demonstrate aligning two eyes on a face shape.  
- Show how grouping keeps features together when the body is moved.  
- Let learners practise aligning a few simple shapes in rows or columns.  

---

## Part B — Make: Simple Character

- Start from a basic body shape (e.g. cylinder, box, or rounded shape).  
- Add eyes, mouth and optional features (hat, ears, arms) using smaller shapes.  
- Use **align** to centre eyes or line up details on both sides.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Add a simple base or stand so the character can sit on a shelf.  
- Encourage participants to name their character and briefly explain its design.

## Resources

- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Tinkercad — Place, move and see your design:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  
- Projector or large screen  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- Remind learners not to crowd the screen — work in pairs at most if sharing devices.  
- If prints will be made later, avoid very thin arms or necks that could easily snap.
