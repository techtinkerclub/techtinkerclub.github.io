## Week 2 — Align, Group, Holes

**Focus Concept:** Combining shapes precisely with align, group, and holes  
**Mini-Project:** *Stamp or Cookie Cutter (no food use)*

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants will complete a **mini-project** — *Stamp or Cookie Cutter (no food use)* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use the week’s core tools in Tinkercad.
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model.
- Share, discuss, and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help, if needed).

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **align**
- **group**
- **ungroup**
- **hole**
- **solid**
- **boolean**

---

## Part A — Explore Align & Group
- Practice aligning shapes along axes.
- Group/ungroup; create cut-outs using holes.
## Part B — Make: Stamp Cutter
- Use text or icon shape to create a raised or recessed pattern.
- Add a handle and test fit in preview.
## Part C — Extend & Share
- Try curved shapes like cylinders or rounded boxes.
- Discuss print orientation.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

---

## Equipment
- Laptops/Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit/pan/zoom)
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models
- Headphones (if watching short videos)

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing/printing; only adults operate printers.
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap.
- Encourage careful mouse/keyboard use and screen breaks.
