This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Blinking LED Card (simulated)* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).

## Key Vocabulary
- **Breadboard** — a reusable board with holes for quickly building circuits without soldering.
- **LED** — a small light‑emitting diode that lights up when current flows the correct way.
- **Resistor** — a component that limits current to protect LEDs and other parts.
- **Polarity** — the direction that current is allowed to flow in a component.
- **Simulate** — run a virtual version of a circuit on the computer to test it safely.

---

## Part A — Explore Circuits
- Place components on the breadboard and wire a simple circuit.
- Run the simulator and fix common polarity or connection mistakes.

## Part B — Make: Blinking Circuit
- Build a basic blinking LED circuit using a resistor and LED.
- Optional: add a microcontroller in the simulator if time allows.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Capture a screenshot of the circuit and label its main parts.
- Link the virtual circuit to real‑world components you may have seen.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
