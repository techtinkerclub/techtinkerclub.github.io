## Week 9 — Structure & Stability (SimLab Earthquake)

**Focus Concept:** Building stable structures and testing them with simulated earthquakes  
**Mini-Project:** *Anti‑Fall Tower Challenge*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using SimLab to apply forces and test structures.</li>
    <li><strong>Science:</strong> Forces, vibrations and how buildings respond to shaking.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Designing towers under constraints (height vs stability).</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Comparing heights and using simple ratios (e.g. base width vs height).</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Using bracing and wide bases to improve stability.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This week participants build a **tower** in SimLab, then subject it to virtual earthquakes, improving the design to keep it standing.

## Objectives

- Build a tower using beams and connectors in SimLab.  
- Test the tower with earthquake forces.  
- Strengthen the design using bracing and wider bases.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can build a tower that stands before the earthquake starts.  
- I can run an earthquake test and describe what happened.  
- I can improve the design to survive stronger shaking.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Stability** — how well something stays upright.  
- **Bracing** — diagonal supports that stop a structure wobbling.  
- **Base** — the bottom part of a structure that carries the load.  

---

## Part A — Build: First Tower

- Give simple rules (e.g. minimum height, no grouping all parts into one block).  
- Let learners build a basic tower from beams and joints in SimLab.  

---

## Part B — Earthquake Test

- Run an earthquake simulation at a gentle level.  
- Ask: Where did it break? Did it sway, buckle or topple?  

---

## Part C — Improve & Share

- Add **bracing**, thicken key parts or widen the base.  
- Test again at a stronger level.  
- Share “before and after” designs and talk about which changes helped most.  

---

## Resources

- **Tinkercad SimLab overview:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/simlab>  

---

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- Emphasise that this is a simulation, but link to real‑world earthquakes sensitively.  
- Encourage respectful discussion if any learners have experience of earthquakes.
