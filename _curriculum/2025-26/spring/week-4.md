## Week 4 — Duplicate, Patterns & Basic Mirror

**Focus Concept:** Repetition and simple symmetry in 3D designs  
**Mini-Project:** *Symmetric Creature or Rocket*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using duplicate and mirror as “manual loops” for repeated parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Planning and building up designs from repeatable modules.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Lines of symmetry and repeated patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Art &amp; Design:</strong> Balance, rhythm and repeated decorative elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Keeping a design balanced so it would stand or move straight.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This week participants use **duplicate** and **mirror** to build a symmetric creature or rocket, thinking about balance and repeated details.

## Objectives

- Use **duplicate** to copy shapes quickly.  
- Use **mirror** to create simple bilateral symmetry.  
- Apply repetition and symmetry to a creature or rocket design.  

---

## Success Criteria

- I can duplicate shapes instead of rebuilding them from scratch.  
- I can mirror parts so the left and right sides match.  
- My design looks balanced and roughly symmetric.  

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Duplicate** — make an exact copy of a selected shape.  
- **Mirror** — flip a shape across a chosen axis.  
- **Axis** — an imaginary line the mirror tool uses to flip shapes.  
- **Symmetry** — when both sides of a shape match.  

---

## Part A — Explore Duplicate & Mirror

- Demonstrate duplicating a single block into a row or stack.  
- Show how mirroring an arm, fin or eye can create a symmetric pair.  
- Let participants practise mirroring simple pairs of shapes across a centre line.  

---

## Part B — Make: Symmetric Creature or Rocket

- Start with a central body (creature torso or rocket fuselage).  
- Add one side feature (arm, fin, eye, booster), then **duplicate and mirror** it.  
- Encourage learners to keep checking the design from all angles.  

---

## Part C — Extend & Share

- Add repeated decorative elements (windows, spots, stripes) using duplicate.  
- Ask participants to show where the line of symmetry is on their model.

## Resources

- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  

---

## Equipment

- Laptops / Chromebooks with internet  
- Mouse per device  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes

- For any prints, avoid very thin, spiky parts that could break or be unsafe.  
- Remind learners to save regularly and keep filenames meaningful.
