## Week 4 — Mirror & Symmetry

**Focus Concept:** Mirroring shapes and designing with bilateral symmetry  
**Mini-Project:** *Symmetric Creature or Rocket*

<div class="notice--steam">
  <h2>Connections to STEAM Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> Using a digital 3D environment and (in Week 8) Codeblocks to generate geometry.</li>
    <li><strong>Design &amp; Technology:</strong> Iterating models to meet a brief; thinking about materials and print constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Maths:</strong> Measurement in millimetres, symmetry, and simple parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Art &amp; Design:</strong> Aesthetics, colour choices, and visual balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Strength, stability, and how parts fit together.</li>
  </ul>

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants will complete a **mini-project** — *Symmetric Creature or Rocket* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use the week’s core tools in Tinkercad.
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model.
- Share, discuss, and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help, if needed).

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **mirror**
- **symmetry**
- **axis**
- **plane**
- **balance**

---

## Part A — Explore Mirror Tool
- Mirror parts across chosen axes.
- Use align + mirror for clean symmetry.
## Part B — Make: Creature/Rocket
- Block out silhouette with basic shapes.
- Mirror limbs/fins and add details.
## Part C — Extend & Share
- Discuss stability in prints (flat base).
- Pose ideas for future upgrades (wheels, slots, stands).

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>

---

## Equipment
- Laptops/Chromebooks with internet and Tinkercad accounts
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit/pan/zoom)
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models
- Headphones (if watching short videos)

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing/printing; only adults operate printers.
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap.
- Encourage careful mouse/keyboard use and screen breaks.
