## Week 4 — Mirror & Symmetry

**Focus Concept:** Mirroring shapes and designing with bilateral symmetry  
**Mini-Project:** *Symmetric Creature or Rocket*

This week’s session is hands-on and creative. Participants complete a **mini-project** — *Symmetric Creature or Rocket* — to apply new tools and build confidence.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and use this week’s core tools in Tinkercad.  
- Apply design thinking to make a simple, working model that fits a brief.  
- Share, discuss and improve designs based on feedback.

---

## Success Criteria
- I can explain what today’s tools do and why I used them.  
- I can make and adjust a 3D model to fit a simple brief.  
- I can export or prepare a model for printing (with help if needed).  

---

## Key Vocabulary
- **Mirror** — a tool that flips a shape to make a reflected copy.
- **Symmetry** — when parts of a design match across a line or plane.
- **Axis** — an imaginary line used for rotation or mirroring (X, Y or Z).
- **Plane** — a flat 2D surface that can be used as a mirror or slicing line.
- **Balance** — how weight or visual detail is shared so a design does not look lopsided.

---

## Part A — Explore Mirror Tool
- Mirror simple shapes across the X, Y or Z axis.
- Combine Align and Mirror for neat, even designs.

## Part B — Make: Creature or Rocket
- Build half of a creature or rocket and then mirror it to finish the other side.
- Check that the base is flat so the model could stand or print.

## Part C — Extend & Share
- Add small, deliberate asymmetries for character (like a scar or different eye).
- Discuss how symmetry helps with stability and appearance.

## Resources
- **Tinkercad:** <https://www.tinkercad.com>  
- **Official Lessons Library:** <https://www.tinkercad.com/learn>  
- **Codeblocks (Week 8):** <https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks>  

---

## Equipment
- Laptops or Chromebooks with internet access and Tinkercad accounts  
- Mice (recommended for easier orbit, pan and zoom)  
- Optional: 3D printer access for selected models  
- Headphones (if watching short videos)  

---

## Safety & Setup Notes
- Supervise slicing and printing; only adults operate printers and hot equipment.  
- Avoid overly thin parts that can snap or become sharp.  
- Encourage careful mouse and keyboard use and short screen breaks where possible.
